What is the article's question?
The article's objective is to present estimation and inference methods for econometric models that are characterized for having many regressors available, potencially larger than the number of observations itself. In this context, the article discusses a family of methods called High Dimensional Sparse regression models, that can potentially deal with the problem mentioned above.

What are the strengths and weaknesess of the article to answer this question?

An important strength of the article is that presents a way to remove the usual bias that l-1 regularized estimators have, via the post-model-selection estimator. It also goes beyond mean regression models, and discusses methods that can deal with "quantile regression and generalized linear models in HDS settings". A final strength resides in that the article shows converge conditions and rates for the Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators, that depend, among other things, on certain theorems being satisfied and the data length.


How does the article advance on the knowledge of the question? What is the contribution of the article?

The main contribution of the article resides in that it presents a tractable series of different estimation methods for HDS models (Lasso, Iterated Lasso, Squared Root Lasso, etc) that can be applied under many scenarios and have attractive properties (computational or/and theoretical). Another important contribution is in exploring the case of Instrumental Variables using the Lasso method.


What would be the next steps to advance in this question?

It is hard to say, but we could consider, as the authors suggest, to show alternative approaches to dealing with the problem of having many plausible regressors. It would be also important to extend HDS methods to other kinds of economic models, beyond the ones considered in the article.
