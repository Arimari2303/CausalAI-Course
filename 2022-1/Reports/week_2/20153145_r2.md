# Report 2: Inference for High-dimensional Sparse Econometric Models - A. Belloni, V. Chernozhukov and C. Hansen
**Names: Claudio CÃ©sar Cabrera Young**

1. **What's the research question of the paper?**

The research question of this paper is the following: 
Taking an  approximately sparse (nonparametric) model that is generalized enough so as to treat problems with a high-dimension set of possible potential, and the existence of an unknown subset of actually necessary predictors to explain such problem (i.e. HDS problems), which are the possible and the best methods for such High-Dimensional Sparsity models(HDS from now on) models?
2. **What are the strenghts and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answer such research question?**
The main strenght of this paper is that the authors part-by-part analysis of the possible treatments for the model they specified, which is didactically possible in great part due to their specific statement of the  model they set at the beginning as part of the Condition ASM (pages 03-04). With such model specification, they address treatment approaches in the following aspects and for the following parts of the model:
- Identification of the relevant regressors, via the use of Lasso method: 
This analysis is related to the shrinkage of the set of parameters that make up the support $T$ ($= support(\beta)$), via the acquisition of the estimator $\hat{T}$.
- Estimation of the parameters for the previous chosen regressors, via the of post-Lasso: 
This analysis is related to the parameters within regression function $f(z_{i})$ in equation 2.2.
- Election of target calculation of the herein addressed model, namely the election of a mean- or quantile-form as the target calculation in the regression function.
This anaylsis is related to the form of the function $f(.)$ for which z_{i} is its argument in equation 2.2 and also 2.1. 

As it can been noted, the detailed statement of the model that is part of the Condition ASM allows for a integral and succint revision of the different aspects of the optimal method election to solve a HDS problem.

Other strenghts are a) the comparisin between methods (OLS, Lasso and post-Lasso) they made b) the several examples they give throughout the paper and c) the applications for structural effects they analyze.

A weakness of the paper is they don't use more "common" names for certain statistical objects they use in their explanations. Being the paper full of complex statistics, they could have made it easier to read for novel readers if they have made a brief list of statistical objects used in the paper, so is easier to google the terms. For example, for $*O(.)* they could use the term "rate of convergence" and for l_{p} (not the $p$ in the articl; just $p$) they could use the term "metric spaces".

3. **How does this paper develop the knowledge regarding the answers to such research question?**

This paper develops a good analysis of the plaussible methods and applications for the generalized case in which the set of relevante predictors for a HDS problem is unknown. Also, they provide the reader with the application of HDS methods in such case (as opposed to the case where the set relevant predictors are known). They also show how the methods they analyze can be used in the estimation of structural effects. 


4. **Which would be the next valuable and specific step o steps to advance toward richer answers such research question?**

Maybe they can revise the content written in this paper in the presence of non-Gaussian erros for the model. They can also comment
