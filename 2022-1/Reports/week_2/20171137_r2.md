In the article by Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2017), the research question is what the use of high-dimensional sparse (HDS) models and methods is specifically in instrumental variables (IV) models and partially linear models that are widely used to estimate the structural economic effects. In line with this question, the authors ask themselves the following:
- How do select the set of appropriate regressors from the total set of an HDS model?
- How to estimate the regression function? (Estimation methods)
- What are the inference results of the models?

Regarding the strengths of the document to answer the research question, it is noted that the authors present simulation and empirical examples to demonstrate that the methods presented can be used in a useful way in partially linear and VI models. Likewise, the differentiation between sparse and approximately sparse regression models is highlighted.
Regarding the weaknesses, the following are found. First, the use of the l1 penalization is just only one method of performing estimation with high-dimensional data. However, it is necessary to consider that there are other methods to estimate structural economic objects. Second, the analysis of HDS models and methods is oriented towards partially linear and instrumental variable models, but they are not the only models used by researchers. Third, although the Sup-Score test ensures the efficient use of high-dimensional data, the problem is only addressed when the scores are independent across the observations.
The main contribution is the presentation of the use of HDS models and methods since these methods allow us to address the problems that arise when researchers work with high-dimensional data.
Finally, three additional steps are rescued to advance with the answer to the research question posed. First, include more methods to estimate structural economic objects to understand their behavior in HDS models. Second, it is necessary to extend HDS models and methods beyond the economic models presented. Third, address the problem of poor approximation by sparsity assumption when the observation scores are not independent.
