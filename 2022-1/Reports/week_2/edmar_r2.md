 1 What is the research question of the article?
This paper analyzes the methods of estimation and inference of high dimensional sparse (HDS) regression models in econometrics. It shows sparse and approximately sparse regression models and their conditions, as well as sparse estimation methods, but focusing and analyzing quantile regression methods and generalized linear models in high dimensional sparse environments.

2 What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
One of the qualities of this paper is that it presents a solid theoretical and econometric approach and its subsequent empirical application and the way the text is structured allows to have the main notions where the models are presented, compared and the best estimation methods are chosen.  Furthermore, his explanations are followed by econometric fundamentals and show graphically how with Lasso the sparse approximations are best fit.

3 How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution?
The contribution of this paper is based on the discussion of methods for the identification of a set of regressors and the estimation of their coefficients based on the $\ell_1$-penalization and the description of the main theoretical results, achieving in this way to expand the possibilities of working with high dimensional data. Additionally, the authors present a comparative dynamics used to be able to choose the most appropriate method in each case they present.

4 What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
As presented in the paper, the authors' work has been focused on the $\ell_1$-penalization estimation methods, but there are many others that can be investigated. And in economics, extending the HDS model to other applications taking into account that the analysis of high dimensional data where there are many weak signals within the set of variables considered in which case the sparsity assumption may provide a poor approximation.
