The paper in question is called "The Mincer Equation Thirty Years after Schooling, Experience, and Earnings" by Thomas Lemieux in 2006. As many years has passed since 
one of the most famous empirical models was create and there has been a great expansion in the computer power and the number of micro data sets available for empirical 
labour economic research, the author tries to evaluate the empirical performance of the Mincer earnings equation in more recent years. To achieve this, Lemieux, as a way
to revise the Mincer model as a benchmark in economics research, ask the question: How does the Mincer equation stand in light of the advances in empirical labour 
economics? 

To answer this question the author analyses every variable of the original equation. This equation (1) states as follows: where y is earnings (y0 is the level of
earnings of an individual with no education and no experience), S is years of schooling, and X is years of potential labour market experience.

$$ (1) \; log (y)= log (y_{0})+ rS+ \beta_{1}X+ \beta_{2}X^2 $$

The author revises every variable of the equation to demonstrate of whether its nature is logarithmic, linear or quadratic. In addition, he points out some remarks on 
the limitations of the model and on how to fix them. In summary, the author concludes that the Mincer equation remains a good approximation to various cases in
economics.  The method used in this paper is to use data sets different periods to proof how consistent the model is. The author uses three periods (1979-1981,
1989-1991, and 1991-2001) from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and looks on the result for white males in the USA.

On one hand, this method helps to show that the curve of years of education against the logarithm of earnings changes is convexity over time being steeper in recent
years than before. This shows that there is no linear relation between variables but it changes over time. In addition, recent research show that the standard Mincer
equation understates wage growth for younger workers. The quadratic specification also predicts a spurious decline in wages among older workers. This can be solve by
adding higher order polynomials in potential experience. Comparing the first period with the last two, in 1989-1991, and 1991-2001, the college-high school wage gap
tends to decline as a function of experience. The experience-wage profile has clearly become steeper for high school than college graduates over the last two decades.
This result means that the more recent data do not fit the standard Mincer equation as in the early Census. 

On the other hand, one limitation of the approach of the author could be in the population selection. By choosing only white males in the USA, it must be note that
results, may vary from other population groups such as ethnic and gender groups where the convexity and concavity of the curves may behave different. If the time
influences the result due to changes on labour market demand, there are reasons to think that other population groups have different labour demand due to historical
factors; therefore, it may differ with the original equation. Nonetheless, the results of Lemieux are useful to contrast further results. 

This paper contributes to the literature because it puts into question whether a very common econometric model holds robustness over time. It is important to go back to 
older models and test if with the new data today holds its relevance. As the author suggest, nowadays there are more data available in contrast of when the Mincer 
equation was establish. It is responsibility of the academic community to test back models to achieve better results and avoid fallacies.
