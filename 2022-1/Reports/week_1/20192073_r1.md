### REPORT 1: THE "MINCER EQUATION" THIRTY YEARS AFTER *SCHOOLING EXPERIENCE, AND EARNING* (2006)
#### What is the research question of the article?
Mincer equation $log Y = log \gamma_0 + rS + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2$ is one of the most influential econometric specifications in the field of labor economics, but in recent years new parametric and non-parametric econometric techniques, as well as new data, allow us to analyze the Mincer equation specification.
For this reason, what is the state of the Mincer Equation given all these empirical and econometric advances?
#### What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
One of the paper's strengths is that it demonstrates the inaccuracy of Mincer's equation in capturing the desired effects on a person's level of education and experience.
The paper demonstrates that, over time, the Mincer equation must be modified for this regression to be accurate with the new data by changing the specification of this equation  respect to age or experience.
One weakness is that existing problems in labor markets other than those of developed countries are not taken into account.
For example, in Peru there is a high level of informality that could cause the estimates to be incorrect under the Mincer equation.
In addition, data from the United States were mainly used, so it would be plausible to argue that in other countries this type of specification should be different from the equation proposed by Mincer, generating biased results.
#### How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)
One contribution is that the paper demonstrates that Mincer's equation underestimates or overestimates the effects of experience and level of education on log earnings.
Another contribution of the paper is that it explains the evolution of the variation suffered by the Mincer equation  respect to the variables of education and experience over the years, as well as the current state (as of 2006) of the literature and advances respect to the Mincer equation.
#### What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?
In Peru, it would be very beneficial to estimate the changes that occur in the specification of the Mincer equation over years in order to get better estimates and results.
On the other hand, I think it would be very important to propose the specification of the Mincer equation under technological progress because technological progress could cause new states in labor markets.
