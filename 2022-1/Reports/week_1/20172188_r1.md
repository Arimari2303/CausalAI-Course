## I. Investigation question

The author intends to answer the situation of the Mincer equation thirty years after the publication of Schooling, Experience and Earnings. It seeks to review the reference model.


## II. Strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering the question

It's useful from Mincer's equation and make a couple of modifications. Model comparison helps to identify the shortcomings of the reference formulation. Also review the models and results of other authors to validate your hypotheses supports your hypothesis.
As a weakness could be finding only two improvements to the Mincer model. You could have tried adding certain control variables that are being omitted.


## III. Contribution/ Reason for publication

The document shows the weaknesses of the model and that in certain cases it can give inaccurate results. It provides strategies that modify the Mincer equation so that the estimates are more precise. This contributes to any research paper that intends to use this equation as the basis of its regression.
The Mincer equation remains an important and widely used reference in research. However, it ignores certain relationships that can lead to an inaccurate result. Being so used, the error is dragged job by job. With a contribution to this equation such as this document by Lemieux, the approximations of future research would be more precise if they take the recommendations of this document.


## IV. Next steps to move the question forward

The next steps to advance the question would be to try new equations that give us a more precise result. In my opinion, currently the technology has increased remarkably. Jobs use new programs and for this people are necessarily updating their knowledge. However, there are also external factors that can modify the expected salary. For example, a crisis, economic growth in their respective country. In addition, there are new jobs that do not require previous studies and one can increasingly see that you do not need as many studies to generate high income. These variables may not change the relationship between wages, education and level of experience so much, but they do influence income. It would be interesting to assess the performance of long-term studies. For today's studies may be useless tomorrow.
