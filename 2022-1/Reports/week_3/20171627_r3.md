# Causality: The Basic Framework & A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
## Chapter 1: The Basic Framework
The first chapter discusses three important concepts to understand causal inference: the potential outcomes, the necessity of multiple units, and the role of the assignment mechanism.
First, potential outcomes are defined as the outcome of an action (treatment) applied to a unit (physical object, a firm, an individual at a particular moment of time). This is helpful to understand the definition of causal effect, which is the comparison of potential outcomes, for the same unit, at the same moment. However, it is not possible to learn the unit-level causal effect value just from the single realized potential outcome (it is not possible to go back in time). Therefore, the causal effects can be estimated comparing observed outcomes from multiple units. 
Second, as mentioned before learning about causal effects typically requires multiple units. One option is to analyze the same physical object at different times as the same unit. However, this approach is very problematic (e.g. we can confuse experience with causal definitions). An alternative to this first approach is to observe different physical objects at approximately the same time. Although more accepted, this second approach still needs a list of assumptions to consider. Those are included in the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUVTA), , which incorporates the idea that units do not interfere with one another and the concept that for each unit there is only a single version of each treatment level.
Thirdly, because causal effects are defined by comparing potential outcomes (only one of which can ever be observed), they are well defined irrespective of the actions taken. But, because we observe at most half of all potential outcomes, and none of the unit-level causal effects, there is an inferential problem associated with assessing causal effects. In this sense, the problem of causal inference is, as pointed out in Rubin (1974), a missing data problem: given any treatment assigned to an individual unit, the potential outcome associated with any alternate treatment is missing. A key role is therefore played by the missing data mechanism, or, as referred to it in the causal inference context, the assignment mechanism. This mechanism is used to answer the following question: how is it determined which units get which treatments or, equivalently, which potential outcomes are realized and which are not? 

## Chapter 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference
This chapter reviews some of the antecedents of the causal inference literature. It focuses mainly on the contribution from Neyman and Fisher.
Neyman made three contributions: He provided an explicit notation for potential outcomes, an implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption and implicit consideration of a model for the assignment of treatments to units that correspond to the completely randomized experiment. 
Additionally, Fisher proposed the physical randomization of units and introduced the randomization experiments.
