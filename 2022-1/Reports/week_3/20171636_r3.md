## Chapter 1: Causality: The Basic Framework

In order to explain in detail the analysis of causal inference, the author, in the first chapter, provides us an introductory framework, in which he includes three key notions that underlie the causal inference approach: (1) potential outcomes, (2) the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) and (3) the Assignment Mechanism.

The potential outcomes refers to the outcome of an certain level of action or treatment applied to a unit (which can be a physical object, a human being or a group of  objects or people at a particular point in time). Using this definition, the author defines the causal effect as the comparison of two potential outcomes for a unit: the potential outcome of a unit exposed to a treatment at a certain time (active treatment) versus the potential outcome of the same unit exposed to the alternative treatment at the same time (control treatment). As its name indicates, there is only one potential outcome that will be realized, which is the potential outcome corresponding to the action actually taken. Regarding the other potential outcome, this will not be observed, since it has not been realized.

However, with the intention of evaluate causal inferences, we need to use multiples units, some exposed to the active treatment, others, to the control treatment. However, to test causal inferences, we need to use multiples of units, some exposed to the active treatment, others to the control treatment. The author gives several options to obtain these multiple units, among which are: observing the same physical object under different levels of treatment at different times or observing different physical objects at approximately the same time. 

Nonetheless, the first option falls into the error that the same physical object at different times is the same unit. The second option can also generate errors, since it is possible that the treatment recieved by one unit could affect the outcome of another unit. This is why we need to make several assumptions based on the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). SUTVA holds two components: the no-interference component, which assumes that the treatment applied to one unit does not affect the outcome of other units, and the no hidden variations of treatments, that states that a unit with a certain treatment level cannot receive different forms of that treatment.


Now, the question is how each individual came to receive the treatment level actually received? This added to the problem that we can only observe the potential outcomes of the units that are exposed to the treatment, we can realize that we have a problem of missing data. This is why we need to use the assignment mechanism to determine which units receive which treatments or, equivalently, which potential outcomes are realized and which are not. It is important to mention that in order to predict these potential missing outcomes and obtain more precise estimates, it is necessary to include a row vector containing the covariates or pretreatment variables (a priori).

## Chapter 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

In this chapter, the author presents the antecedents of the potential outcomes approach reviewed in the previous chapter. He finds that Neyman, in the 1920s, was the first to introduce the concept of potential outcomes in random experiments and to develop a mathematical notation. Among his other contributions are the implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption, and the implicit consideration of a model for the assignment of treatments to units that corresponds to the completely randomized experiment. Furthermore, the author finds that Fisher, in 1925, used randomization to evaluate causal effects and introduced the concept of randomized experiments. Finally, he mentions that Rubin, in 1974, made two important contributions: he establishes  that potential outcomes should be used for the analysis of causal effects in both experimental and observational studies and formulates mathematically the dependence of assignment mechanisms on potential outcomes.
