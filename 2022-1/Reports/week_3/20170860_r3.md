# Report 3: Causality: The Basic Framework (Imbens and Rubin)

## What is the research question of the article?

The authors want to state a framework for causal inference:
- "There is no causation without manipulation", means that you need to apply a treatment for your group of interest to compare the effects of the treatment with a group that didn't receive any. Those are the potential outcomes of the experiment.
- The need of multiple individuals aviable to be part of the experiment.
- The importance of the assignment mechanism, that will help us to get the better potential outcomes that answers our question of interest.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?

The main strength  of the article is the detailed explanation of the causal effect. Also, it describes the needing for an assumption of stability in the most common case of multiple units of observations, also called STUVA. This helps us to obtain solid potential outcomes. 

As a seminal work about causality, it doesn't have many weaknesses. The use of a helpful example such as the aspirine causal effect even get the work better.

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, it does. As it is mentioned earlier, it is one of the first works about causality, and helped to create a basic framework of causality.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

There are many papers that followed this paper, and was useful to create new tools to explain many questions in other fields, such as Economics, Medicine or Biology.
