The authors do not directly mention the research question they seek to answer, but I can infer that they try to answer if there are other methods (from machine learning techniques) that help to obtain heterogeneous causal effects between subgroups of the study population in experiments or observational studies without the estimation losing precision or the confidence intervals being invalid due to sample partitioning.

Therefore, in their study they propose heterogeneous estimation methods of causal effects from an “honest” estimation approach. For this approach, the tree regression method is used, but modified to improve the goodness of fit of the treatment effects. Furthermore, this approach is achieved by dividing the training sample into two parts: one to build the tree and partition the covariate space; and another to estimate the effects of the treatment within the leaves of the tree. The above is what makes the model honest, since machine learning methods (such as regression three) are adaptive; that is, they use the same data to select the model and estimate, which causes spurious regressions between the covariates and the results (this is what the authors call the adaptive method).

Thus, the main contribution that the authors make is to offer the academic public of researchers methods that allow the data to discover which are the relevant subgroups and obtain the causal treatment effects within each subgroup without losing the validity of the constructed confidence intervals.
Also, as the authors mention, a key contribution of this article is to show that the criteria for both building the partition and for cross-validation change when using an honest estimate. In that case, the split and cross-validation criteria are adjusted to ignore systematic bias in the estimate and instead focus on the trade-off between a more personalized prediction.
