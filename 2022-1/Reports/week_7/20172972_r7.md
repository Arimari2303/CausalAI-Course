## What is the research question of the article? 

In my view, the research question is try show three methods for estimating heterogenety in caussal effect. This three methods are based from cross-validation, wich helps to use the assumption unconfoundedness (randomization conditional on the covariates). This assumption will help to partition the data in two (testing and estimating). 
Also, to do the three methods the authors mentioned an important asumption that is honest aproach, which is correlated to the partition, because this aproach is not use the same data to select the model structure as for estimation given a model structure. This aproach, as well, will do that the bias be eliminated. So, the splits or partitions will be reflect the criterion of the mean squared error (MSE), the splits will be optimum.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strength to answering the research question is present all the literature and mathematical theory about some modifies that will have the cross validation and the honest aproach. Because, this modifications will change the partitions and did it more optimum. Also, this theory adjusted the MSE and the partitioned data, because it could be, depends of the researcher, more than 2 kind of data. 
In other view, this theory can help to understand the adjusted models that the authors present to estimate the heterogeneity in the causal effects. 
\
In my point of view, the weaknesses appears when the authors just mentioned the literature, not given us examples about then. Making the paper more mathematical and statistic than literature, and this theory will be confused for people who don't have an intermedian knowledge about it. 
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
The contribution is for the researchers from science, economics and medicine, like the authors mentioned in the paper. Because, now they can find, with adjusted machine learning, the caussal effect of a treatment (like vaccines, social proyect, politic, experimetn, etc) for subsets of the population, heterogenously.
\
## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
The next step to move forward is go depper in literature to show more examples where the three models, mentioned by the authors, can use. As well, go depper in the models to create another one maybe adjusting in a special case, that always exist speacially in social sciences.
