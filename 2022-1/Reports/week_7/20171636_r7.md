## Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects



In this article, Athey and Imbens seek to answer how we can solve the problem of covariate heterogeneity in causal effects in both randomized experiments and observational studies, and how inferences about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. To solve these problems, the authors propose the honest estimation method, which is based on regression trees and is especially useful for studies where the number of units observed is less than the number of attributes of each unit.


The main strength of this article is that it uses theory and performs a simulation to demonstrate that this honest estimation method generates better results both in the MSE of the treatment effects and in the coverage of the confidence intervals  across estimation methods and settings compared to other approaches such as adaptive estimation, which generates overfitting. To demonstrate this, some fundamental assumptions of the conventional classification and regression trees (CART) are modified. First, an independent sample of estimation is chosen to estimate leaf means and then the splitting and cross-validation criteria are modified to construct unbiased estimates of the MSE of the causal effect of the treatment. In addition, it includes within its theoretical review four partition estimators for causal effects, which are the causal tree (CT) estimators, transformed outcome trees (TOT), fit-based trees (F), and statistical T-squared (TS) trees, for the same purpose.

On the side of weaknesses, it can be mentioned that this article has not included any simulation using real data, for example, from an observational study associated with medicine, sociology or economics. In other words, when performing the simulation, the authors presented only data and results, but did not mention what the analysis study is about.

The main contribution of this article is that the authors propose the honest estimation method, which is a new method to estimate the heterogeneity in the causal effects for both randomized experiments and observational studies and provides valid confidence intervals without restrictions on the number of covariates. How is this achieved? Splitting the training data in two parts: some part of the sample is used to build the tree structure and the other part of the sample is used to estimate the treatment effects for each subpopulation or leaf of the tree. 

Another contribution, which derives from the application of this honest estimation method, is that the authors manage to show that the criteria for constructing the partition and cross-validation change when we anticipate an honest estimation, in such a way that they are adjusted to ignore the systematic bias in estimation and focus on the trade-off between a more personalized prediction (i.e. having fewer observations in each leaf) and the variance that will arise in the second stage (honest estimation) due to noisy estimation within small leaves.

As mentioned before, the next steps would be to apply this methodology in observational studies to determine if the honest estimation method effectively minimizes the MSE when the treatment effects are re-estimated in the second stage and obtain valid confidence intervals.
