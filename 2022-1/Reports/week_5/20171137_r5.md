- What is the research question of both articles?

In the article by Cinelli, Forney, and Pearl (2022), the research question is how simple graphical criteria can be used to decide when a variable should (or should not) be included in a regression equation. The authors ask if a given variable is a bad control or good control in line with this question. 
On the other hand, in the article by Hunermund, Louw, and Caspi (2022), the research question is what the performance of double machine learning (DML) is when even a few bad controls in the covariate space are included. In response to the question, the authors show that DML is very sensitive to the inclusion of bad controls.

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of both papers' approaches to responding to that question?

The strength of the first article is that the authors provide practicing analysts a concise, simple, and visual summary to distinguish good from bad controls through illustrative examples. In addition, to demonstrate that strength the authors present three cases of bad controls discussed in applied research.  The weakness of this article is when considering multiple controls, the status of a single control as good or bad may change depending on the context of the other variables under consideration. However, this weakness can be a strength too because even when considering multiple variables, the main lessons from the illustrative examples remain. Another weakness is that there are cases when the causal effect of X on Y cannot be identified from the DAG structure alone.
On the other hand, the strength of the second article in responding to the research question is the comparison between DML with irrelevant controls, naive lasso, and DML with bad controls. Relying on this simulation, the authors can show the DML is very sensitive to the inclusion of bad controls. The weakness of this article is that the analysis of the DML’s sensitivity is made based on the context of the decision whether include or not one control (D), but the stage considering multiple controls was not evaluated. 

- How do the papers advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and the referees decided to publish the articles).

The first document’s contribution is the development of a tool that allows researchers to respond to the discrepancy of whether to include a control. 
The second document’s contribution is to show that the DML despite being based on double selection criteria not necessarily select suitable control variables.

- What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

Regarding the first article, the next step to move forward on the question is to complement the use of the DAG structure and the sensitivity analysis. In addition, the researchers can show the use of DAG with illustrative examples when you have multiple controls.
Regarding the second article, the next step to move forward on the question is to continue the comparison of DML with other double selection approaches.
