# Report 6 (Abadie, Athey et al.)

## What is the research question of the article?

The research question of the article is if the standard framework of cluster standard errors derives unbiased variance estimators, and if it is possible to improve the knowledge proposing two new variance estimators when clusters matter in the causal explanation. Fundamentally, this paper tries to solve some problems that clustered samples faces in Economics, because of the quantity of observed clusters that affects the variance estimation.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?

First, the authors motive the reader presenting an empirical research, where it is plausible to see that the most popular variance estimators, the robust and cluster method, derives biased estimations (lowing the estimation in robust case, and inflating in case of standard clusters). Then, combining both methods, the authors proposed a new consistent estimator, the casual cluster variance (CCV) estimator; and other estimator based in bootstraping the sample, most important when we can't observe all the clusters.

I can't find any weakness in the paper, because it is well built and easy to read.

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yest, it does. It proposes two new and consistent estimators for the variance in samples that constains clusters. It will be useful for new researchs, because modern datasets tend to be clustered by many factors, and these new methods may be the key to more interest researchs soon.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

I think that in the future, new authors will review previous papers that uses the standard cluster framework and adjust the estimations using the CCV and bootstrap estimators.
