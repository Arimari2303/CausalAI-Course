## Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application

Using a simulated database from the National Study of Learning Mindsets study and the causal forest method, Athey and Wager seek to answer whether the mindset intervention had an effect on improving student achievement; whether the effect of the intervention moderated by school level achievement or by pre-existing mindset norms; and  wether there are other covariates that moderate the  treatment effects . This causal forest method is used to be able to correct  the selection problem presented by the simulation and the considerable heterogeneity across the randomly selected schools in the base.


One of the strengths of this article is that it first gives us a brief overview of causal forests with an emphasis on addressing  issues related to clustered observations and selection bias. Specifically, the authors make adjustments to the causal forest method applied to observational studies, in order to improve the precision of the estimates and give us an example of application.The second strength is that it presents and explains the code used in R, which will allow us to replicate this procedure in other studies.

Regarding the limitations, one that I found is that it is possible that the problems mentioned above (selection problem and the considerable heterogeneity across the randomly selected schools ) and that are found in the sample are due to the construction of the sample. We may be able to avoid these problems, and thus the use of causal forest, if we use the original data.

The main contribution of this article is that the authors not only give us the steps to follow to apply the causal forest, but also provide us with an application example for the problem of heterogenity treatment effect accros groups, specifically for observational studies. In addition, the authors give us the code in R to be able to replicate these steps in other types of databases. This is why the next steps should be to estimate these heterogeneous treatment effects using other methods (apart from the causal forest) to find out if there are other methods that give us more precise estimates.
