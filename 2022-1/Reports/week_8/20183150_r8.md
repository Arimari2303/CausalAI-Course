## What is the research question of the article ?

* The research question of the article is : How effective it was to apply the causal forest method to respond to the objectives of the National Study of Learning Mindsets: an observational study.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

*  Strengths: the document shows how the method presented acts well on a study that at first glance may be random, but is really observational, since some individuals are more likely to receive the treatment, in addition to using random forest to make inferential statistics. Also, explains the methodology used step by step with the objective of each algorithm.
* Weakness: they did not discuss why of all the 139 schools that tomarin under consideration only 76 agreed to volunteer and what observable or unobservable characteristics there may be in those 76 schools that have influenced volunteering for this experiment, and whether this has influenced the ploliferation effect of the new mindset.

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  The document shows a guide on how to apply causal forests, and provides a link for readers to replicate it, as well as briefly explains the idea of applying causal forests to observational studies in a general way, and uses authors in it.

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  An advance to answer this question even more is to study more the characteristics of the student himself beyond the characteristics of the type of classroom in which he studies; in fact, the authors identify that some students may have more expectations of success than others, and this may have an impact on the effect of the new mindset, so it would be important to investigate what determines that a student has higher expectations of success.
