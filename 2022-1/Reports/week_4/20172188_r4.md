# I.	Research Question 
The paper explains how and why Double Lasso regression is a principal method for variable selection. To do so, it presents arguments in favor supported by different authors, explains the Double Lasso estimation method and shows case analyses in which it is beneficial to use the Double Lasso method.
# II. Strengths and weaknesses 
As strengths the article shows the main reasons that make necessary the use of a more sophisticated method to select variables, such as the reason of having bias in the estimators by not choosing well these variables: the coefficients of interest (these can be artificially strong or weak). Also, using works by Darlington (1990), Zhou and Fishbach (2016) Wilkinson (1999), Rosi (1990), among others that justify this issue supports the authors' hypothesis. On the other hand, explaining in detail how the process is and showing analyses in which double Lasso regression is used for variable selection helps the reader to understand the method in more depth. 
As a weakness, the authors could expand on the explanation of their analyses, the context, etc. They could also add what weaknesses the model has. 
# III.	Contribution/ Reason for publication
The article is useful for the scientific community that uses regressions in their hypothesis testing, because the correct selection of variables is important to find better relationships between independent, dependent and covariate variables.  In my opinion, I believe that it was necessary to publish this article because many times the choice of variables for regression is not given due importance. There are biases both by including or excluding variables. The method works for both data sizes, so it is useful for those who are unsure about the number of variables to use in the regression. 
# IV. Next steps
The authors could mention methods other than the double Lasso method to solve the bias due to poor choice of variables. Also, explain if there is any argument against this method. Finally, extend the explanation of the analyses presented.
