## Using Soble Lasso for Principled Variable Selection

In this article, Urminsky, Hansen and Chernozhukov aim to introduce double lasso regression as a method for selecting the appropriate covariates to include in model estimation.To do this, the authors explain what double lasso regression is, why it is useful, how this method can prevent the problem of principled variable selection for covariates and present four case studies using data from the psychological literature.

One of the strengths of this article is the introduction of the double lasso selection as a solution to the covariate selection problem. The authors explain that within this covariate selection problem there are biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses and underpower analyses even in effectively randomized experiments. To avoid these problems when identifying covariates to include in their analyses, the authors recommend that researchers apply a double lasso regression in three steps. The first step is ,using a lasso regression,to predict the dependent variable and focus on variables with non-zero estimated coefficients; the second is ,using a lasso regression, to predict the focal independent variable and focus on variables with non-zero estimated coefficients and the third is , using a linear regression, to predict the dependent variable on the focal independent variable including the covariates selected in previous steps. 

Another strength is that this paper give us four practical cases where they compare this method of covariates selection and other methods (for example, regression including no covariates, including all covariates, “p-hacking” selection, among others), thus demonstrating that the  double lasso selection allows better identification of which covariates to include and not include in the analyses.

However, one of the limitations of this article is that using only four cases with data from psychological studies does not give us strong evidence that this method should be the rule when determining the covariates to include in studies from other disciplines. Furthermore, although the lambda penalty term is important for reducing the estimated coefficients towards zero, thus reducing overfitting and selecting for important covariates, this term is not explained in detail, which may confuse the reader.

This article contributes to knowledge by introducing double lasso regression as the best method to select covariates in psychological studies, since it combats the problem of omitted variables. As mentioned before, one of the next steps should be to replicate these exercises using data of other types (high dimensional data) or other specialties (Economics, Physics), in order to verify if this method is the best to identify the necessary covariates.
