## What is the research question of the article ?

* The research question of the article is : How to use the double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters?

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

*  Strengths: the authors explain how this new method reduces variance and compensates for the possible bias that a control variable could suffer; that is, a variable with poor control (several pathways). In general, the authors use Maching Learning (ML) tools to solve the coefficient bias of a control variable within a regression. ALso, they explain mathematically how, behind ML tools, bias problems are solved. Cross-fitting, data division (sample - training), lasso, random trees, among others, are used. They also mention several authors with empirical studies to better explain the ideas.
* Weakness: the article does address what is desired, but that same motivation for addressing a very extensive topic is what tends the text to be considered purely mathematical and very broad. Maybe it would have been a little better to focus only on one point to develop it. 

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  Since one might think that ML tools could easily fix some prediction problems such as bias, the authors emphasize that there are certain conditions that must be met for each problem. Occasionally, a very recurrent condition is Neyman's orthoganility, which is explained in the article, as well as other types of conditions. 

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  The next step in addressing the bias problem is to deal with situations when there are no parametric problems and publish code in some programming languages for readers.
