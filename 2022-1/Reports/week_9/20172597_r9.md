The authors address the following goal: they tackle the semiparametric problem of inference about a low-dimensional parameter in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters. To do this, on the one hand, they estimate high-dimensional nuisance parameters using machine learning methods, such as lasso and regression forests, so that a causal inference can be obtained from the objective parameters. For this section, the authors highlight the importance of constructing adequate moment conditions for the estimation. To do this, they make use of the Neyman orthogonal score using two approaches: the nuisance finite parameter approach and the concentration approach.
Likewise, for their methodology they use cross validation to obtain a less biased estimate.

Therefore, consider that the research question is the following: is it possible to eliminate the overfitting in the estimation of the parameter of interest and the impact of the regularization bias using orthogonal Neyman scores and cross validation? A great strength is that this innovative methodology using simple and understandable machine learning tools contributes to the literature on causal estimation and inference in high-dimensional settings. Another strength of the article is that they also complement the study by presenting empirical applications of their DML proposal, such as the effect of the unemployment insurance bonus on the duration of unemployment. The next steps, following this paper, are to think of other types of machine learning methods that may be able to generate more robust effects, and to make a comparison between all those that are discovered.
