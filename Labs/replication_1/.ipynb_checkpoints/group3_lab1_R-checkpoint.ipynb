    "##An Inferencial Problem: The College-Educated Wage Gap\n",
    "Using the data from the March Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey (2015) , in  this lab, we are going to focus in  payments of the college-educated workers and answer the following inference question:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference in predicted wages between workers with some college education (scl)versus college graduate workers(clg)?\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the College-Educated Wage Gap, we consider the following log-linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\log(Y) &= \\beta'X + \\epsilon\\\\\n",
    "&= \\beta_1 SCL  + \\beta_2' CLG + \\beta_2'W   \\epsilon,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where  SCL is the indicator of workers with some college education( 1  if   0  otherwise), CLG is the indicator of workers with some college educationand the  ùëä 's are controls explaining variation in wages. Considering transformed wages by the logarithm, we are analyzing the relative difference in the payment of men and women.\n"
