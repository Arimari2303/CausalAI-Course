The idea can be summarize in three steps:

<ul>
<li> We have to randomly partion the data into training and testing sample. Usually, the ratio is 75 (training) and 25 (testing). For example, the total data is 100. Randomly 75 values will be selected for the training group and 25 will be the test group.</li>    

<li> Then, the training data is what we will use to estimate the regressor coefficients. Once those estimates are obtained, they are used to evaluate their prediction quality on the test data (out of sample).</li>

<li> </li>
