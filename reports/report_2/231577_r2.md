# Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis

The article focuses on developing a reliable model to predict property prices on Airbnb using ML and natural language processing techniques. The central question asked by the researchers is how to reliably predict the rental price of a property on Airbnb using property characteristics, owner characteristics and sentiment analysis of customer reviews as explanatory variables.

On the one hand, the main strength of the article is the integration of sentiment analysis to the model, an approach that had not been widely investigated in the literature and that adds explanatory power.

Another strength that adds value is the wide use of methodologies, from linear regression, to SVR, K--means and neural networks, which allows to compare the effectiveness of each one for the specific case and to make a comparison.

On the other hand, a weakness was the lack of performance of the more complex models over the simpler ones, in this case, neural networks and K--means + Ridge regression did not significantly outperform Ridge regression being a simpler one. This is due to the insufficient number of training examples due to having too many unknown weights.

All in all, the article demonstrates the usefulness of sentiment analysis as an important feature when predicting real estate prices on the platform.
Furthermore, it identifies SVR with RBF kernel as the most effective model for this specific dataset, outperforming the other methods in accuracy and error reduction.

Finally, the next step to move forward with the topic is to investigate other feature selection techniques, specifically, the authors mention the importance of studying a Random Forest to increase the performance of the model. It is also possible to expand the dataset to include more training examples, which would improve the performance of more complex models such as K-means clustering with Ridge Regression.
