Título: Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis

The article addresses the challenge of accurately determining prices on Airbnb due to the limited information available. Owners face the tough decision of setting a price that attracts (or doesn't deter) clients, while the latter lack an optimal reference point to assess their options. In response to this issue, the research focuses on developing a predictive pricing model to assist both owners and clients in evaluating prices, considering the minimal information available about the property. For this purpose, it makes use of machine learning techniques, deep learning, and natural language processing.

A strength of the article lies in its emphasis on the feature selection process, where various techniques were implemented and compared to identify the one with the best performance. However, the paper has weaknesses in trying to achieve its objective. Firstly, the database consists of Airbnb listings located in New York, which likely makes these predictions not applicable to other cities, given New York's unique characteristics and generally high prices.

Since the focus is on predicting optimal prices for properties, the prices in the data may not be useful. These prices are set by the owners, who, according to the authors, set them knowing they will affect the number of customers they will attract, and are likely influenced by other characteristics considered by the owner. This implies that the prices in the data could be biased, suggesting that the property price does not necessarily reflect its true optimal value based on its characteristics; it could be overvalued or undervalued. By using these prices in the learning process, the machine will not learn to predict a fair price, but rather will learn to predict a price influenced by such bias.

An innovative contribution of the article is the incorporation of sentiment analysis from previous customer reviews as a new feature for the predictive model.  This addition, which does not directly refer to the physical characteristics of the property, is relevant as it can help counteract the inherent bias in prices set by property owners. 

Moreover, even if the predictions made represented the optimal price, when calculating the accuracy of the predictions, this predicted price is compared with the actual price of the property, which is biased. Therefore, even though the price is optimal, when compared with the biased price, this predicted price would be considered "incorrect". In other words, the accuracy would be lower than what it should actually be.

Finally, thanks to economics, we know that the market price tends to be the fair/optimal price, as it results from many interactions between buyers and sellers. Thus, this logic could be adapted to the objective of the paper. It is appropriate to use this dataset to obtain a price prediction based on the characteristics of the property, but the accuracy shouldn’t be measured as a one-to-one comparison with the real value but with the average price of the properties with the same characteristics. A next step could involve using a clustering technique (for example, K-Means) to group properties according to their characteristics and observe how much does the price prediction approximates this average, or in other words, market price. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, comments from previous customers can be used with the clear intention of mitigating this bias in the price set by the owners.
