# Report 1: Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis. [Kalehbasti et. al)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12665.pdf)

## (1) What is the research question of the article?

The article's research question is what kind of machine learning model can better and reliably predict the price of a rental property on Airbnb. To do so they use a large set of features available in the public Airbnb dataset for New York City. Some methods used in deveoloping some of the models are tree-based models, support-vector regression, and K-means clustering, among others. 

## (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The main strength of the article is the use of customer's sentiment analysis and neural networks, which are the key contributions to the literature. On top of that, the presentation of results is very clear. In particular, figure 2 is extremely helpful to compare the performance of different methods, and how ML methods improve the manual selection of features which is serves as a baseline. 

One weakness, the article sheds little light on what are the main determinants (features) of rental property on Airbnb. While the discussion about the methods employed is great, commentary on the importance of different features is helpful to the reader and it's specially important given that customer's reviews are used as a feature, unlike previous literature. 

## (3) How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

The paper contributes to the literature by showcasing in practice several feature selection techniques. It also implements Neural Networks and customer's sentiment analysis, which was something missing from the previous literature. 

## (4) What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

It would've been great to test the models using other datasets, maybe from other states. Also, given that customer's sentiment analysis isn't found in the literature, it begs the question how does the inclusion of this specific feature further improves the performance of the models.
