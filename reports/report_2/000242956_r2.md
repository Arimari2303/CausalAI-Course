# Report 1: Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis. [Kalehbasti et. al)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12665.pdf)

## (1) What is the research question of the article?

The article's research question is what kind of machine learning model can better and reliably predict the price of a rental property on Airbnb. To do so they use a large set of features available in the public Airbnb dataset for New York City. Some methods used in deveoloping some of the models are tree-based models, support-vector regression, and K-means clustering, among others.
