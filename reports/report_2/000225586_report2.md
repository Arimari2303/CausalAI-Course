Ppaer: Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis

⮚ What is the research question of the article?
What is the best way to come up with the best-performing model for predicting the Airbnb prices  with limited information(limited features)
⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
The Strengths of this paper seems to be the wholeness of ML methodologies tested and its comparison within then as a sort of attempt to figure out which is the best
The Weaknesses of this paper comes up by the explanation of why they choose the models and the almost null literature employed. An advice would be to explain the importance of the models they utilize, their strengths and their limitations on this specific context 
⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
The paper gives a step forward into the attempt of understanding the advantages of the LASSO model compared to the others listed in the Methods section. But it is not clear whether this advantage is valid into other scenarios (external validity) or whether is it only a result by chance 
(If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided
publish the article).
⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
Being clear about what are the context specific aspects for which this methodology is better than others, as well as the limitations of the method
