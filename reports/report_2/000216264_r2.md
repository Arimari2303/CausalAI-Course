# Airbnb price prediction with sentiment analysis and neural network

#### What is the research question of the article?

The question this article aims to answer is how to develop a reliable price prediction model for Airbnb in New York City. To improve the prediction performance, the authors incorporate customer review sentiment analysis and neural network, models. In addition, they preprocess the data fixing or deleting the missing values, transforming boolean or string features into numeric data types, removing those that are irrelevant, and converting the categorical features into dummy variables. Then, they create a new feature with the sentiment analysis mean score of the customer reviews on the pricing of the Airbnb listing. The third step consists of comparing the R-square score of the linear regression model using the features selected from different methods. Finally, the authors select the features according to the Lasso feature selection method and compare the MAE, MSE, and R-square from different machine learning and deep learning models.

#### What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The approach the authors use has three main key strengths. First, the fact that they include language processing techniques to create a new feature not only helps to improve the quality of the prediction due to incorporating relevant information, but it also makes an innovation in the literature. Second, the inclusion of a baseline model (with all the features) as a benchmark serves as evidence of how much the same model could improve if the variables are selected with other methods (by hand, according to the feature’s p-values and Lasso feature selection). This is also valid for the model’s comparison. Third, with cross-validation, the authors can compare the MAE, MSE, and R-square results in the training and test data between the models and choose models without overfitting and with the best out-of-sample prediction.

As for the weaknesses, I think that there was some difficulty in using models that included cluster methods because of the data characteristic –there were not enough examples in every cluster. Also, it would have been a good idea to compare the models with and without the review sentiment feature. Furthermore, to have more evidence that justifies the feature selection made, the authors could have included other machine learning selection methods, such as the PCA, to have more evidence that justifies the feature selection made. 

#### How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

The creation of the new variable with the customer reviews was a great advance in the literature. Incorporating sentiment analysis could become a relevant part of the prediction if text data is available. The use of neural networks was also a novel contribution in the case of price prediction of rental properties. 

#### What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

Besides the three ideas the authors mentioned that future work can incorporate, I propose two important next steps to advance this question: i) the comparison of the models in a more extended dataset, for example: other cities in the US or even between countries; ii) the incorporation of the host’s photo for generating a new feature of its first impression with machine learning image recognition algorithms. This last step could lead also to discoveries of the relevance of a friendly profile image on the likelihood of renting or not the property.
