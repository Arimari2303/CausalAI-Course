## Research Question
This article aims to create a model that predicts Airbnb rental prices using machine learning, deep learning, and sentiment analysis. It looks at rental features, owner traits, and customer reviews to forecast prices accurately.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths:
- **Various Model Assessment:** The article evaluates different models like linear regression, Ridge regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network, giving a thorough analysis.
- **Feature Selection Techniques:** Using these techniques enhances model performance, identifying the most important features for price prediction.
- **Real-world Data:** The study uses a public Airbnb dataset for New York City, adding credibility to the findings.

### Weaknesses:
- **Limited Scope:** The study only focuses on New York City Airbnb rentals, limiting its broader application.
- **Lack of Comparison:** Although SVR performed the best, there's no detailed comparison of all models, which could have added depth to the analysis.
- **Future Work Mentioned:** The article mentions future work but lacks detailed exploration, leaving room for ambiguity.

## Contribution to Knowledge
This paper showcases the effectiveness of Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel in predicting Airbnb prices. It provides insights into factors influencing rental prices, advancing knowledge in the predictive modeling of short-term rentals like Airbnb.

## Next Steps
- **Cross-Location Validation:** Testing the model on Airbnb datasets from different locations to assess its performance across diverse markets.
- **Incorporating External Data:** Adding local events, economic indicators, or seasonal trends to improve predictive power.

By addressing these next steps, researchers can refine the price prediction model, making it more robust across various contexts in the hospitality industry.
