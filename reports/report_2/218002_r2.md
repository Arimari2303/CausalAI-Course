Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment AnalysisWhich caracterictics undermines the price of an Airbnb?Rentals,Owner Characteristics,Customer Reviews,Comparisons Among Predictors.Insights from Available Information:Literature Contributions: This study contributes to existing literature by implementing neural networks for predicting Airbnb prices. Additionally, it leverages sentiment analysis on customer reviews to gain deeper pricing insights.Dataset: The research is based on data from Airbnb listings in New York, including various types of accommodations. Sentiment analysis was conducted on reviews, with scores ranging from -1 to 1.Feature Selection: Techniques such as reducing error variance, tuning coefficients with Lasso regression, and selecting features with the lowest p-values from linear regression were employed. The best results in terms of explaining the variance were obtained using Lasso regression.Models Employed:Linear Regression: Utilized techniques such as Ridge regression.Non-linear Regression: Included models like K-means Clustering, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Networks, and a Gradient Boosting Tree Ensemble.Experiment Findings:Lasso Feature Importance Analysis: This analysis, focusing on validation via the R-squared metric, revealed that SVR yielded the highest R2. Following SVR, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel showed promising results. However, Ridge regression and K-means did not perform as expected due to limitations in their architectural complexity, stemming from insufficient training examples.Conclusions and Future Directions:Conclusions: The study found that a Lasso-based feature importance analysis helped in refining model specifications, leading to reduced variance. SVR emerged as the best-performing model, demonstrating a higher R2 in explaining pricing variances.Future Work: Future research could explore alternative selection schemes such as random forest models. Additionally, further experimentation with neural networks is recommended to deepen the understanding of how these models can be optimized for predicting Airbnb prices. Gathering more training examples from a broader range of hospitality services could also provide valuable insights for future studies.
