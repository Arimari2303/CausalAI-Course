⮚ What is the research question of the article?
The article aims to develop a reliable price prediction model for rental properties on Airbnb to aid both property owners and customers. 
The model will utilize minimal available features as inputs.

⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
The strengths lie in three main aspects: the incorporation of new information as input for this type of model (compared to existing literature), customer 
reviews analyzed through sentiment analysis, a variety of feature selection techniques, and comparison of different models to determine the most effective 
approach. However, despite introducing innovation to the literature, it was not fully exploited, lacking explanation on its relevance and why its integration 
distinguishes the paper from others (it could be the case that this feature does not provide predictive power). Therefore, the complete achievement of 
the goal to assist customers is not reached.

⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
(If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided
publish the article).
The contribution includes exploring various feature selection techniques to reduce model variance and improve efficiency. Additionally, sentiment analysis incorporates 
customer opinions, addressing information asymmetry issues and evidently impacting property prices. Overall, a holistic approach to the problem is achieved by 
incorporating property information and customer feedback.

⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
The next step involves conducting a deeper analysis of sentiment analysis techniques and their impact on price prediction accuracy.
