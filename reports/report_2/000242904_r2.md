# This is the report 2 for paper "Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis" of Pouya Rezazadeh Kalehbasti, Liubov Nikolenko and Hoormazd Rezaei

The article show us how to use Machine Learning in a a very common topic in Economy: stablish a price. In this case, the authors give us the example of a price prediction of a very valuable service in these days, which is a reserve in an AirBNB

As I said, the question here is how can we merge ML and real problems. More specific it should be what factors contribute to the pricing of Airbnb listings, and how can machine learning algorithms combined with sentiment analysis of guest reviews be utilized to accurately predict Airbnb rental prices?

The good point of this project is the tools that they use from economy, historic databases and machine learning. We can mention historical data from Airbnb, such as property characteristics (location, size, amenities, etc.), booking data, and previous pricing information, as well as guest review data. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or more advanced methods like neural network models are employed to construct a predictive model. However when we use unobserved variables like sentiment anlysis, we can incur in measurement problem which affects our prediction. Another weak point is that in this market which have a big amount of competitors, if you want to enter, probably you will set a price in the media of the AirBnbs that are near, so you don´t exactly need a model

I like this paper beacuse we can find projects that help us in this way to combine ML and Economy. Researches can try to make models which are linear (or not), or use sentiment as a very near concept to variable that can help us in prediction.

I think that the next two steps is to update the paper and try to make the same exercise but in a country that are afraid to buy a service online like Perú.
