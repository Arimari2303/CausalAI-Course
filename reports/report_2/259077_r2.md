The article aims to build a price prediction model to improve the accuracy of pricing in Airbnb for both customers and owners. On one hand, owners have to evaluate their properties by acknowledging their characteristics and comparing them to the market. Nonetheless, the estimated price might be biased as owners try to earn more money or lack complete information about similar properties. On the other hand, customers possess very limited information to precisely determine a fair market price. In that basis, machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing techniques are employed to reach the maximum possible accuracy given minimum information about the property. The main goal is to offer a reliable valuation of the property given only its most prominent characteristics and some additional information. 

The major strength of the article is the comparison between different techniques in both: the feature selection process and the machine learning methods for price prediction. In the first stage, the authors put a lot of emphasis on the feature selection process in order to reduce the high variance of error. For this purpose, they employ three different selection processes to obtain the best feasible R2 while reducing overfitting. With this set of options the authors successfully reduce the number of features and compile those with the greater importance. In a second stage, they consider several machine learning models to find the optimal one. Similarly they compare the performance metrics of the trained models and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. This active comparison between methods helps to enhance the quality of the results. 

On the side of weaknesses, as the authors warned first hand, there is a hidden bias in the prices used for the data. As they were taken from Airbnb itself, these are the prices owners personally publish,  and in many cases it does not reflect the intrinsic value of the property or its fair market price. Therefore, accuracy can’t be measured by comparing the predicted value with the real value of the observation. Accuracy should be measured by comparing the predicted price to an average price of the properties with the same characteristics. Thus, we can really observe if the price adapts to the dynamics of supply and demand in the Airbnb market. 

The paper contributes by testing a set of feature selection techniques, pointing out the importance of reducing the number of features while maintaining high prediction capacity. An appropriate selection allows to implement different machine learning methods and obtain similar R2 in all of them, just as the authors outline in the “Experiments and Discussion” section. Another contribution lies in introducing sentiment analysis through customer reviews. As it is highlighted in section 3.1 customer reviews play a crucial role in Airbnb price listing and must be included in the model. 

For instance, a valuable next step is to find a way of measuring the approximation of the outcome to the fair market price. In other words, evaluating if a given property (observation) with determined characteristics adjusts to the valuation of the market. This market price might be calculated as the average price of similar properties. A second step might be to continue developing the feature importance analysis. The authors mention that although the input vector was largely reduced it still was relatively large and could cause model overfitting or trouble for some of the models.
