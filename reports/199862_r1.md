What is the research question of the article?
Do news methods at the intersection of Machine learning benefit economics more than traditional econometrics?

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
Strengths: Methods that include Machine learning achieve efficiency when working with a large sample. Also, greater precision is highlighted in the results. 
Weaknesses: The Machine Learning literature is much more concerned with overfitting than the standard statistics or econometrics literatures. Researchers attempt to select flexible models that fit well, but not so well that out-of-sample prediction is compromised. 

How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
Their contribution is the recommendation of the complementary use of Machine Learning methods and traditional econometric approaches. In large samples, the use of ML improves predictions and extracts insights.

What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
Establish criteria for the robustness and significance of machine learning methods.
