# Machine Learning and econometrics methods: The relevance in economics

Athey and Imbens (2019) explore whether the machine learning (ML) toolkit used in the literature is relevant for empirical economists, particularly in research. They present several estimation problems that economists may encounter, including supervised and unsupervised learning, causal inference, experimental design, matrix completion problems, and text data analysis. The authors compare the most used methods from each discipline, taking into consideration the goals of the estimation and the nature of the data. They found that the ML methods are a valid substitute for currently used econometric techniques, in most cases. As a result, they question if the quality of the estimators is more important than achieving better predictions or if the selection of the explanatory variables should be theoretical or data-driven.

The authors do an excellent job because they take into consideration the different goals each approach has when comparing their results –estimators’ quality vs. reduced overfitting for better predictions. Therefore, to evaluate which model might be better in each case, they look at accuracy and inference power.  They also situate us in different parts of the estimation process to make this comparison: for example, for the selection of the parameters, regression shrinkage methods (such as LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Nets) and Random Forests demonstrate to have “good predictive properties” even with a great sparsity, “ignoring irrelevant features”. In the case of the training sample selection, they explain that the out-of-sample optimization method has better results than fitting the model in-sample. Lastly, for making inferences, econometrics models are usually better but at the expense of predictive performance. Nonetheless, there has been progress in low-dimensional ML models, but for other cases, it is hard to build confidence intervals for inference.

Even though this is a complete review in terms of the presentation of the most used models, they don’t mention which performance metrics available in ML or econometrics they are considering for saying why it has better performance or better prediction. Also, perhaps for someone who only has a background in economics, not defining what consists of each ML method or regression could make the lecture more complex.

Although there are already reviews of the most useful estimation methods in ML, the main contribution of the authors is the research and selection of the principal cases an economist may encounter, and the respective algorithms used in ML and econometrics. They mention methods to choose optimal policies, predict the utility of consumers for making recommendation systems, perform A/B testing in experimental settings using the UCB approach, and analyze text with the latent Dirichlet allocation model.

I believe that to advance the literature on this topic, it would be insightful to present the pros and cons of prioritizing the goals established in econometrics vs. ML. Alternatively, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both fields can help improve each other. For instance, the authors mentioned that there is still room for improvement in the inference part of some advanced ML models. Therefore, the strength of econometric inference can contribute to the development of inference with ML models.
