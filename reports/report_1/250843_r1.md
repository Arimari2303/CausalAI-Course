The article presents two alternatives in the world of statistics for reaching conclusions from data: data models and algorithmic methods. The latter emerged as an alternative to traditional statistical models and have been extensively developed both theoretically and practically. However, despite the potential benefits offered by this array of tools, a niche in statistics refuses to adopt these methods: econometrics. Based on this phenomenon, the authors seek to answer the question: Why has the adoption of algorithmic models been much slower in the field of econometrics? The authors argue that this field requires an update through the integration of machine learning techniques if the primary goal is to obtain conclusions from data. And based on this assertion, the article also attempts to answer: How can we adapt these methods to economics?

Regarding its strengths, firstly, the authors clearly present the differences in terminology and objectives between ML and econometrics. They specify how their general objectives differ, as econometrics seeks to obtain estimators of interest while ML methods seek prediction. However, despite both branches starting with different objectives, algorithmic methods can attempt to adapt to the needs of economic problems. Furthermore, another strength of the article is that it offers a comprehensive explanation of various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, along with some applications to econometric problems. For example, in Chapter 5, it mentions the use of k-means as a way to organize the sample into types of units that can receive different exposures to treatments. Also, in Chapter 3, it highlights how the random forest method has been adapted to address causality problems and parameter estimation in economic models despite its predictive origin. 

A major weakness of the paper lies in the lack of clear and tangible examples illustrating how machine learning methods can be applied in economic contexts in some of the described methods such as boosting (in chapter 3) or generative adversarial networks (in chapter 5). This lack of concrete examples can hinder the understanding and visualization of the potential applications of ML for statisticians and economists.

The document contributes by disrupting the econometric community. It takes a deep look at the tools offered by Machine Learning and how they can be applied in econometrics. It also highlights the progress and achievements made by these methodologies, as well as their impact on academia in general. Additionally, it delves into how Machine Learning could be the solution to solving problems within econometrics, thus opening new doors both in research and practical applications. It urges economist to not fall behind and adopt this new set of innovative tools.

Finally, a valuable step towards advancing the central question of the article could be to develop hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of traditional econometric models with machine learning techniques. For example, researchers could explore methods that combine the interpretability of linear regression with the predictive power of decision trees or neural networks. Furthermore, efforts could be made to improve the interpretability of machine learning models in econometrics, allowing economists to understand and trust the predictions made by these models. The development of transparent machine learning models tailored to econometric applications could facilitate this process.
