- What is the research question of the article?

The article aims to explore the disparities in objectives and considerations between traditional econometrics and machine learning literature, 
and how these variances influence the selection of particular methods.

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

Strengths: The document effectively compares the goals and concerns of traditional econometrics and machine learning literature, 
offering valuable insights for researchers. It also sheds light on how these distinctions affect method selection, 
enhancing comprehension in the field.

Weaknesses: The document lacks empirical evidence or case studies to support claims about differences between traditional econometrics
 and machine learning literature. Integrating real-world examples could bolster the argument and provide practical insights for readers.

- How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

This paper reviews and compares the objectives, methods, and contexts of traditional econometrics and machine learning literature in economics. 
It introduces specific machine learning methods crucial for empirical economists (as supervised learning and matrix completion) and discusses
challenges in their application. By emphasizing the necessity for economists to incorporate machine learning methods, 
it helps bridge the gap between traditional and modern approaches in economics. Additionally, the paper introduces new terminology and concepts
that can be usefull if you are interested in improving predictive performance.

-What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

One valuable step would be to conduct empirical studies directly comparing the performance of methods from both approaches on real economic data.
This would offer concrete evidence of their differences in predictive power and accuracy.
Another valuable step could involve developing guidelines for economists on integrating machine learning methods into their work, 
considering the field's specific goals and concerns. This would offer recommendations on when and how to use these techniques alongside
traditional methods for different types of economic research questions.
