## Report 1: Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know About (Susan Athey & Guido W. Imbens, 2019)

### 1) What is the research question of the article?

The main focus of the article is to discuss the relevance of Machine Learning for economics and econometrics, exploring how they can be utilized in these fields. It addresses various methods of Machine Learning and their applicability in economic studies, emphasizing their usefulness for tasks such as prediction, classification, and handling missing data. Furthermore, it examines the integration of Machine Learning with econometrics to enhance research processes, particularly in understanding cause and effect relationships, determining optimal policies, and analyzing consumer behavior in response to price changes. Overall, it aims to provide economists insights on leveraging Machine Learning tools to enhance understanding and prediction of economic phenomena, and to have better research tools.

### 2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The main advantage of the article lies in its ability to offer a wide range of alternatives and complementary approaches to implementing machine learning methods alongside established econometric methods and theories. This provides researchers and professionals in economics with a more comprehensive and flexible perspective for addressing data analysis challenges. Additionally, machine learning (ML) models can handle large amounts of data and understand complex relationships. This can open new doors for economic research and decision-making. However, the main weakness is that these models can be difficult to understand and may not always answer questions about causality. So, sometimes it can be challenging to know exactly what the results are saying and how to use them to make important decisions.

### 3) How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided publish the article).

The article provides an overview of how machine learning (ML) can be integrated into economics and econometrics to address complex questions. In addition to reviewing ML methods and their applications in economic research, it also introduces ML concepts and terminology. The importance of incorporating ML methods into economists' toolkit is emphasized to advance towards more modern and effective research methods, along with the need to continue exploring and developing this intersection between ML and economics.

### 4) What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

The next step would be to conduct more comparative studies in real economic scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of ML methods compared to traditional econometric approaches. These initiatives aim to promote greater integration of ML in economic research.
