What is the research question of the article?
The paper seeks to provide a first look at the tools of ML applied to the field of economics, explaining their importance for both predictive purposes (R2) and those of causal inference (confidence intervals) and other uses of applied economics.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
One of the strengths of the document is reviewing the specific terminology of ML compared to conventional econometric terminology. Additionally, it satisfactorily summarizes new concepts such as LASSO, Causal Trees, Random Forest, Deep Learning, and Neural Nets, among others. One of the weaknesses is that it does not provide practical examples for the application of these methods, remaining at a theoretical explanation. This could have improved the understanding of some concepts.
How does this document advance knowledge on the question, that is, what is its contribution?
The document is important for disseminating cutting-edge methodologies and their applications to different branches of economics, as well as encouraging their use in academia.
What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
Implementing these new methodologies in publications to streamline the use of ML.
