# Report 1: Machine learning methods that economists should know about. [Athey & Imbens (2019)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-080217-053433;jsessionid=R04vswSoi5974-zqfQZuFKwoxo-cbiPpq96u4bN0.annurevlive-10-241-10-101)

## (1) What is the research question of the article?

The article's research question is twofold. First, it seeks to explain the main differences in objectives, practice and terminology between the Machine Learning (ML) and traditional econometric literature. Then, it outlines some ML methods that lie in the intersection between ML and econometrics and should be part of the empirical economist's toolkit. Suchs methods include Lasso, Ridge, Trees, Neural Nets, among others, and have practical uses for common causal inference questions in applied economics.  

## (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

One strength of the article is the introduction to the different goals of the ML literature as opposed to the standard econometric literaute. It explains how very often ML methods don't concern themselves with large sample properties and efficiency. As a result, there isn't much effort on inference and confidence intervals. Instead, ML methods deal with out-of-sample predictive power and hence the importance of developing different algorithms. The difference in terminology is also very well stablished by the article and directed towards the empirical economists and econometrician. 

Another strength is the way ML learning methods are presented in a concise way that captures the main idea behind them. 




giving a brief overview of the most relevant ML learning methods. 

Overall, it clearly delivers on the idea that economists should be more open towards ML methods justs as statisticians have done so in the past. 

One potential weakness is the lack of more practical uses of ML methods when it comes to answering causal questions. While the use of such methods was explained from an abstract and theoretical point of view, it would've been great to include more practical examples that were actually included in empirical papers, as well as how those methods gave value added to the research approach. 

## (3) How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

## (4) What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
