# This is the first report due by Alvaro Yllu
What is the research question of the article?

Its main approach is to discuss the relevance of Machine Learning algorithms for economics and econometrics.  In particular, it begins to discuss various methods in which Machine Learning may have an advantage over econometrics and in which Machine Learning can be applied while respecting the theoretical basis for the estimation of regressors and explaining the variance of a given series. 

Besides that, it poses the question of whether or not the confidence interval is as important to the empiric research as theory suggests. This is due to the fact that there are no ways to create confidence intervals for machine learning just yet. 

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The general strength is that it provides a variety of alternatives and complementary ways to implement machine learning methods together with the already existing econometric methods and theory. However, there are no empirical or evidence-based examples in which machine learning is applied to a particular method to solve a problem. 

How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

In general, it reviews the current literature in machine learning and the ways it can be applied to economics and econometric analysis. It is a sort of gateway for students and graduates to go ahead and attempt to explore into each of the various methods trying to find the one which is most convenient to them for their particular research. As such, it is attempting to popularize and invite for greater participation of the economic graduate and undergraduate population to complement their knowledge with machine learning. 

What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

Implement machine learning with a time-series analysis with an evidence-based approach. See how the machine learning method can approach that of the MCO currently being used, thus allowing us to know more about how the analysis matches with current practice.
