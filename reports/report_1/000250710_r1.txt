⮚ What is the research question of the article?
This article addresses the question of the contributions from ML literature to traditional econometrics and statistics, and to what extent these will allow for 
more sophisticated empirical work and effective communication.

⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
The article's strengths lie in several areas: it provides a wide coverage of the differences between traditional econometrics and ML literature, offers
 a detailed explanation of ML's relevance for economists, gives descriptions of several ML tools that economists would benefit from, and criticizes the 
slow adoption of ML methods. However, a notable weakness is the absence of practical examples that would illustrate some of the benefits mentioned earlier in the text.

⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
Overall, the paper's contribution lies in providing an extensive overview of ML methods and their potential impact on empirical research in economics. 
These contributions are related to the disclosure of methods addressing the same problems typically tackled by traditional methods. It is highlighted 
that despite these ML methods do not incorporate economic theory as their basis, these would give some valuable information to improve analysis.

⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
One valuable next step would be to further explore the adaptation and integration of economic theory into ML methods. This could involve developing hybrid 
models that combine the strengths of economic theory with the predictive power of ML methods, ultimately enhancing the applicability and robustness of these 
techniques in addressing economic questions.
