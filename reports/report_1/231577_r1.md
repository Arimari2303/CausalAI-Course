# "Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know About"
This article reviews machine learning methods and their relevance to econometrics, highlighting the differences and advantages of econometric methods versus ML.

The main research question of the article is how new advances in machine learning methodology can be applied to traditional econometrics to improve research processes.

A strength of the article is its emphasis on the ability of ML models to handle large datasets, in contrast to traditional methods. For example, Section 3.1 mentions simple regularized linear models and how they are preferable to traditional methods when the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations. In this case, the ordinary least squares estimator does not have great properties and is inferior to the regularized estimators.

Another strength mentioned is the flexibility of ML models to model complex nonlinear relationships and relationships between predictors. The reason for this characteristic is that networks are capable of learning hierarchical representations of data, through the composition of multiple layers of processing, where each layer transforms the input in a way that the next layer can build up to a more abstract representation of the problem. That is, a deep neural network is able to decompose a complex function as a composition of simpler functions.

One of the weaknesses of neural networks is their lack of interpretability, despite their great predictive power. Unlike a traditional linear model `Y = B_1*X_1+... B_n*X_n + e`, where each coefficient `B_i` has a clear interpretation in terms of its contribution to the expected value of `Y`, ML models act as a "black box," making it difficult to understand the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Another weakness is the relationship between ML models and causal inference, because although ML provides effective tools for prediction, it faces substantial problems in the causal domain. ML has traditionally focused on maximizing predictive accuracy, often at the expense of the ability to make robust statistical inferences. In addition, a premise of ML is the identification of correlations between variables. However, correlation does not imply causation, which is a fundamental principle in statistics. Therefore, if not handled properly, ML models can capture strong associations that do not reflect a true causal relationship.

On the other hand, the paper contributes to the field of economics by providing information to build a bridge between classical econometric models and ML models. The paper highlights how advances in ML can be beneficially applied in economic research, especially in the analysis of large datasets and in the modeling of complex nonlinear relationships. This integration proposes a shift in traditional econometrics, which is particularly relevant in the current era of massive data generation and collection. It also provides a clear understanding of different ML methods (such as supervised and unsupervised learning) and how they can be applied to causal inference and policy analysis, among other areas.

To advance the understanding of economics with ML, a kind of hybrid models can be proposed to improve causal inference. This is because ML can be a good tool for prediction, but cannot find clear causal relationships. For this purpose, regression trees, and in particular random forests, can be combined with traditional econometric methods in several ways. Since each tree is a form of matching estimator, the forest is an average of matching estimators. And the use of instrumental variables can be implemented to address endogeneity and establish causal relationships, although at the cost of losing predictive power. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, hybrid models can be compared with simulations against ML or traditional econometric models.
