**Research Question**

The main question addressed in this article is focused on understanding how the starting level of GDP per person affects the growth rates of GDP per person, especially concerning the convergence hypothesis. The article aims to explore this hypothesis by carefully selecting control factors from a range of variables and examining the connection between the initial GDP level and the growth rate across various countries. Additionally, it discusses the importance of selecting these control factors thoughtfully due to having many variables compared to the sample size, and it investigates the use of ℓ1-penalized methods to tackle this challenge.

**Strengths:**

1. The paper offers a thorough explanation of the convergence hypothesis in economic growth models and emphasizes the significance of estimating the impact of initial GDP on growth rates.
2. It explores the use of control variables to refine the estimation based on country characteristics, which is essential for achieving more precise results.
3. The paper underscores the importance of selecting control variables and the difficulties associated with it, advocating for the use of ℓ1-penalized methods to address this issue.
4. It presents the findings of the analysis, revealing negative coefficients on initial GDP across different models and providing confidence intervals to support the convergence hypothesis.
5. The paper discusses the utilization of Lasso-based IV procedures as a valuable addition to existing methods for estimation and inference with numerous instruments.

**Weaknesses:**

1. Including specific examples or case studies could enhance understanding by illustrating the practical application of discussed methods.
2. While it acknowledges the importance of selecting control variables, it lacks in-depth exploration of the specific criteria or methods employed for this selection.
3. More insights into the limitations or potential biases of the methods used could offer a more balanced perspective on the obtained results.


**Advancements and Next Steps:**

This paper contributes to the understanding of the research question by introducing and discussing estimation methods for High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS) models utilizing ℓ1-penalization. It presents innovative inference results and empirical examples showcasing the broad applicability of HDS models and methods in econometrics. By focusing on selecting control variables in growth regressions with numerous potential instruments, the paper sheds light on the convergence hypothesis and addresses the issue of control variable selection in empirical growth literature. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of employing rigorous estimation methods in econometrics to enhance the validity and reliability of empirical findings.

A valuable next step in advancing the question of high-dimensional sparse econometric models would be further research on alternative estimation methods beyond ℓ1-penalization. Investigating methods proposed by Huang, Horowitz, and Ma (2008), Fan and Li (2001), Zhang (2010), and Fan and Liao (2011) could offer insights into different approaches for estimating structural economic objects in high-dimensional settings.

Another specific next step could involve extending high-dimensional sparse models and methods to other economic model types beyond those discussed in the literature. Exploring the applicability and effectiveness of HDS models in different economic contexts could deepen understanding of how sparsity assumptions impact model accuracy and estimation efficiency.
