# High-dimensional sparse regression (HDS) models for applied economics

The research centers on asking what the best estimation and inference methods for high-dimensional sparse regression (HDS) models in economics are. In particular, the authors answer how to identify and estimate the subset of significant regressors in high-dimensional sparse regression models using ℓ1-penalization (or lasso). In addition, they elaborate on how to perform inference in linear instrumental variables and partially linear models. The research question arises from the availability of large databases with numerous regressors and the need for economists to make a correct estimation of the parameters. 

One of the main contributions of the research approach is the numerous empirical examples it provides of the application of HDS models. For example, the estimation of earnings with an approximately sparse model (ASM), the simulation evidence of instrumental variable selection tests with iterated Lasso, or partially linear models. However, a potential weakness of the paper's approach is the complexity in which the methods are presented. This may pose a challenge for economists who are new to machine learning.

This research is novel in the inference results for HDS regression models and the use of real-life applications, such as estimating the returns to schooling on wages or estimating the GDP growth rate. In addition, the paper discusses estimation methods for instrumental variable and partially linear models, presenting novel inference results for these models. By applying these methods to empirical examples, the article illustrates their applicability in economics. Thus, the article contributes to the improvement of the field by providing economists with tools to handle high-dimensional data effectively and efficiently.

A valuable next step in advancing the field of estimation and inference methods for HDS models would be to explore the behavior of other estimation methods beyond ℓ1-penalization, such as the estimation of structural economic objects mentioned in the paper. Another step could be to extend and analyze the model in other economic cases. This extension could offer new insights and approaches to analyze complex economic variables relationships. Researchers can thus broaden the scope of their analyses and discover new ways to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in econometrics.
