1. What is the research question of the article?

The article strives to study the application of causal forests to the National Study of Learning Mindsets (with sinthetical data), examining how the causal forest methodology can deal with clusterized errors and use propensity scores to be more robust to confounding.

2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

One important strength of the document is that, by controlling for heterogeneity across schools from which students are drawn (school level effects), it can effectively generalize its results to out-of-sample observations. Besides that, the authors derive an implementation of causal forests in observational studies, employing techniques to improve the precision in the estimation of the parameters of interest. Antoher thing to take into account is that the paper makes use of an orthogonalization method, in order for their estimates to be robust to confounding. All of these poses a difference to machine learning based methods, which do not account for them.


3. How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The article advances in the knowledge of the anaylisis of the National Study of Learning Mindset by proposing an alternative methodology to estimate treatment effects in a context of heterogenity across subgroups, and where the probability of treatment assignment is correlated with the motivation of the student.


4. What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

A valuable next step to move forward on the question of the effect of the program is to evaluate and compare the causal forest approach with other estimation methods, and to show, in terms of MSE probably, the effectiveness of this approach. Also, it would be an interesting thing to do to drop the assumption of unconfoundedness, from which we assume that the treatment assignment is random conditional on covariates.
