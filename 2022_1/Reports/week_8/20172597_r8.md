The article presents an analysis using causal forests to study heterogeneous treatment effect on observational data sets, which is one approach among many successful ones for heterogeneous estimation of treatment effect.

The authors have the following challenges: how to make the random forest robust in clausters and then how to use that random forest method to estimate the treatment effect in observational studies (in itself the studied database is random, but it has biases of selection).

One of the strengths of the article is that it is supported by results that have been obtained in other studies, and that help to respond to its main objectives or challenges. Among the main ideas to answer the research questions is that they first use a conservative approach, in which the Yi scores of students within a single school can be arbitrarily correlated within a school or cluster, and then apply robust analysis tools of conglomerates.

The results obtained are the following: First, when taking into account a grouping at the school level, they find that there may be heterogeneity in the treatment, but it is difficult to obtain a precise non-parametric estimate. On the other hand, if they ignore grouping, they find heterogeneous effects and can estimate accurately. Given this situation, a next step in this line of study would be to delve into the discussion of how to work with pooled observations when modeling treatment heterogeneity. Even more specific: perform analysis of the pros and cons of different approaches for heterogeneous estimation of treatment effect on pooled data.
