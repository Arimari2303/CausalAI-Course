## What is the research question of the article ?

* The article focus in what situations its viable the using of double Lasso in regressions, propose an approximation of the usefulness of covariables in investigation. So, the implicit research question of the article is When and how its important the Lasso methodology regression?

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

*  The strenghts of the document is that don't show just a unique example of Lasso, instead use two examples based in previous authors: Chernozhukov y Hansen, also explain the main problem to use Lasso, the covariate selection problem, in addition, use equations to explain the uses equations to explain intuition among the use of Lasso and double Lasso. Last but not least, the article exposes empirical data to show the benefits of Lasso and double Lasso. 

The weakness of the document is that it does not show the robustness of using Lasso beyond two cases whose original authors are in previous years; it would have been good to use more current authors or more up-to-date data.

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  The contribution of the article its that , for beginners that star with OLS regression and its variants, the Lasso and double Lasso will be interesting to learn, because the contribution of Lasso as it self its when a person use big data or a big number of covariables. 

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  A step beyond explaining how Lasso works and the double Lasso is to emphasize in which sectors of economic research this method could be more useful, it could be in the mapping of sales, in the design of a new product or in the gastronomic sector, it would have to be corroborated and documented.
