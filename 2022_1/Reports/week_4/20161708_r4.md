# Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection
## Research question
According to the paper, the research question is the following: How to decide if it is suitable to include covariates and how to select them?

## Strengths and weaknesses of the paper to answering the research question
The double-lasso method can be used when the number of observations is smaller to the number of predictors. In addition, in comparison with a simple lasso regression, which causes omitted variable bias because it excludes variables with non-zero coefficients and generally it underestimates those lasso-estimated coefficient, the method double-lasso overcomes these kind of problems. Apart from this, the paper shows that double-lasso method offers empirical evidence to include variables as controls and it is useful to identify valid covariates in a randomized experiment.

On the other hand, a weakness of applying this method is that it is not possible to determine which covariates have theoretical support to justify their inclusion. Adittionally, it is not possible to explain the effects of the selection of covariates on the relationship of interest

## Contribution of the paper to solve the research question
The authors use a "double-lasso" approach that is helpful to select covariates. In fact, the idea it is to identify them in two steps. The first one is to find those that predict the dependent variable. The second one is to find the variables that predict the independent variable. This last step is important because if the variable is a modest predictor of the dependent variable, but a strong predictor of the independent variable, it might cause a substantial ommited variable bias. Finally, the variables found in either of the two steps are included in the regression of interest.

Through the simulation of the five models, the authors demostrate that using double-lasso it is possible to reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) and to increase the statistical power in comparsion with the rest of models. For instance, the model with double-lasso has a statistical power of 0.579% and this value is close to the true model. Moreover, they present four examples that prove double-lasso is advantageous. The conclusion of one of them is that double-lasso is a tool for validating the effectiveness of randomization, since none of the covariates have a significant relatinship with the dependent variable, for example.

## Next steps to move this question forward

Next steps include promote the use of double-lasso in analyses such as randonmized experiment, which is related to many uses in different fields, for example, in experimental and behaviorsl economics.
