## Article: Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection

-	What is the research question of the article?

In this week’s article, the research question is what the use of double-lasso regression for principled variable selection is. In line with this main question, the authors ask themselves about the decision of whether to control for covariates and how to select which covariates to include. 

-	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper’s approach to answering that question?

Regarding the strengths of the document. In the first place, the authors are able to identify the problem to which their proposal responds. In this way, they mention that even when controlling the covariates could be beneficial, the lack of methods for the variable selection may discourage researchers from doing such analysis. Thus, they propose methods based on lasso regression that offers a viable solution. Second, they argue that the direct use of lasso is not enough, as it can be problematic. So, they propose that the identification of variables be in two steps (double lasso), finding those that predict the dependent variable and those that predict the independent variable. Third, they compare the double-lasso procedure with 5 alternatives and show that their proposal yields better results.
Regarding the weaknesses of the document, it is highlighted that although this analysis tells us which potential covariates have empirical support for inclusion, it cannot determine which variables make logical sense or are theoretically justified to include.

-	How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The main document’s contribution is the proposal of a method that allows you to select covariates that have empirical support for inclusion. This task is extremely important since researchers find themselves in a context in which the methods for the adequate selection of variables are not abundant.

-	What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

The next step to move forward is to improve the double lasso method or develop better methods for variable selection.
