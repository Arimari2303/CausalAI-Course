#### - What is the research question of the article?
The research question of the article is how the double lasso variable selection method can help to improve the empirical selection of the covariates of a model, overcoming problems such as the bias of omitted variables.
#### - What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paperâ€™s approach to answering that question?
The strength of this method is its versatility in overcoming the problem of variable selection in different types of cases such as those presented in the article, as well as the results obtained in the simulation where it is explained that the Double Lasso method has better results than other existing methods. In addition, the main strengths are the improvement in the empirical identification of covariates by the method and the improvement of the effects of the focal dependent variable in the model.
A weakness of the document is that it presents simulations and favorable cases to support the idea that the method can help avoid the variable selection problem, but I believe that there may be cases where the results do not go in the expected direction. Also, the lack of a more exhaustive proof (such as mathematics) lends less credibility to the method.
#### - How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
The contribution of this article is the empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this method in different cases to overcome the problem of identifying covariates in a regression in order to obtain better results in the main variables of an investigation.
#### - What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
In the cases where the method is applied, it is observed that the method can improve the empirical identification of the models, but the lack of a clear demonstration is necessary to show the robustness of this method. This is the next step is to theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
