## What is the research question of the article? 

In my view, the research question is in how situations is better use double Lasso and what is the significant of Double Lasso in that situations. I believe that is the research question because in most of the paper the authors presents diferent cases to use Double Lasso. In the first part of the paper, i think the reasearch question would be why is important Double Lasso to search the important covariables. 

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strength to answering the research question is present diferent cases which is important to use Double Lasso. 
Also, another strength is present in the first part what is the problem researchers (use covariates) and the principal method that they use (randomization), to them explain why randomization could fail and the lack of methods better than radomization. This would be a good strength to introduce the lector to understand why the Double Lasso Method is a important method. This strength is upgrade when the authors explain the Lasso Method in a mathematical way and the comparation between another methods.
\
\
In my point of view, the weaknesses appears when the authors presents the diferent cases. It is because they don't go deep to explain the cases. 
To be clear, i mean when they explain in what cases the Double Lasso can explain more than just choose significant covariates. The significant are important but the results with Double Lasso method too, because not all of this results will be significant and the authors just mentioned two cases when it happens. So this not is helpfull for the reason that this insignificant results could have another interpretation than the two mentioned in the paper. 
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
The document contribution is show why Double Lasso is better to do a experiment and estimation than another method. This is because before the researchers believe that randomization or another methods are better to do their predictions but if they read this paper they could still believe in that or change their mind to the method of their research. 
\
## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
The next step to move forward is show another methods better than Double Lasso or try to build above the Double Lasso another method more precise. This could be another step because in the part when the authors do comparation of diferent methods with the real result use the Double Lasso was the closer than the others but not the same as the real result. 
As well, another step could be put more weird results of experiments where the Double Lasso have another meaning.
