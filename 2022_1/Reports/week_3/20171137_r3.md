## Author: Victoria Olivera

### I.	Chapter 1: The basic framework
•	In summary, the authors discuss three key notions underlying their approach to causal inference.

i.	Potential Results
-	Each corresponding to one of the levels of a treatment or manipulation.
-	Each of these potential outcomes is a priori observable, in the sense that it could be observed if the unit were to receive the corresponding treatment level. 
-	Once the treatment is applied, at most one potential outcome can be observed

ii.	The necessity, when drawing causal inferences, of observing multiple units, and the utility of the related stability assumption are discussed.

iii.	Finally, the authors discuss the central role of the assignment mechanism, which is crucial for inferring causal effects

### 1.	Potential Results
-	The fundamental notion underlying our approach is that causality is tied to an action (or manipulation, treatment, or intervention), applied to a unit.
-	Examples of referred actions:
	* Active treatment: take an aspirin
    * Control treatment (passive): do not take an aspirin
-	Given a unit and a set of actions, we associate each action-unit pair with a potential outcome.
-	The causal effect of one action or treatment relative to another involves the comparison of these potential outcomes, one realized (and perhaps, though not necessarily, observed), and the others not realized and therefore not observable.
-	Any treatment must occur temporarily before the observation of any associated potential outcome is possible.
-	It is important that the causal statement is well defined. 

### 2.	Definition of causal effects
-	There are two important aspects of this definition of a causal effect. First, the definition of the causal effect depends on the potential outcomes, but it does not depend on which outcome is actually observed. Second, the causal effect is the comparison of potential outcomes, for the same unit, at the same moment in time post-treatment.
-	The fundamental problem of causal inference is therefore the problem that at most one of the potential outcomes can be realized and thus observed.
-	For the estimation of causal effects, as opposed to the definition of causal effects, we will need to make different comparisons from the comparisons made for their definitions. For estimation and inference, we need to compare observed outcomes.
	* That is, observed realizations of potential outcomes
	* Since only one potential outcome per unit is observed, multiple units need to be considered.

-   For estimation, it will also be critical to know about, or make assumptions about, the reason why certain potential outcomes were realized and not others. That is, we will need to think about the assignment mechanism

### 3.	Learning about causal effects: multiple units
-	Because at most only one of the potential outcomes can be observed, there is a need for observing multiple units to be able to conduct causal inference.
-	As an alternative to observing the same physical object repeatedly, one might observe different physical objects at approximately the same time.
-	However, by itself, the presence of multiple units does not solve the problem of causal inference since certain assumptions are needed.

### 4.	The assumption of the value of treatment of the stable unit: SUTVA
-	To exploit the presence of multiple units, we use the stability assumption, SUTVA.
-	Statement: The potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units, and, for each unit, there are no different forms or versions of each treatment level, which lead to different potential outcomes.

  ### 4.1.	SUTVA No inference
-	The no-interference component of SUTVA:
	* Justifying no-interference: In our headache example, to address the assumption of non-interference, one must argue, based on prior knowledge of medicine and physiology, that someone else taking an aspirin in a different location cannot have an effect on my headache.
	* There exist settings, moreover, in which the no-interference part of SUTVA is controversial. In large-scale job training programs, for example, the outcomes for one individual may well be affected by the number of people trained when that number is sufficiently large to create increased competition for certain jobs.

  ### 4.2.	SUTVA: No hidden variations of treatments
-	The second component of SUTVA requires that an individual receiving a specific level of treatment cannot receive different forms of that treatment.
-	One strategy to make SUTVA more plausible is based on redefining the treatment levels represented to comprise a larger set of treatments, for example, Aspirin−, Aspirin+, and Aspirin-free rather than just Aspirin and Aspirin-free.
-	A second strategy involves coarsening the outcome; for example, SUTVA may be more plausible if the outcome is defined to be dead or alive rather than to be a detailed measurement of health status.

  ### 4.3.	Alternatives to SUTVA
-	Using subgroups of people as units in such AIDS drug trials. Similarly, in educational settings, SUTVA may be more plausible with classrooms or schools as units of analysis than with students as units of analysis.

### 5.	The Assignment mechanism: an introduction
-	How each individual came to receive the level of treatment that they actually received, in our language of causality, is called the allocation mechanism.
	* This mechanism is crucial for the inference problem

### 6.	Attributes, pretreatment variables, or covariates
-	The key feature of these covariates is that they are a priori known to be unaffected by treatment assignment.
-	The information available in the covariates can be used in 3 ways
	* Make the estimates more precise by explaining some of the variation in the results.
	* The investigator may be interested in the typical (e.g., average) causal effect of treatment on subgroups (defined by a covariate) in the population of interest.
	* The final and most important role for covariates in our context, however, concerns their effect on the assignment mechanism.

### II.	CHAPTER 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

-	The two most important antecedents are presented to put the potential results approach into perspective.
	* Introduction of potential outcomes in randomized experiments by Neyman.
	* Introduction of randomization as the reasoned basis for inference by Fisher
-	The Neyman formalism made 3 contributions
	* Explicit mathematical notation for potential results.
	* The implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption.
	* The implicit consideration of the model for the assignment of treatment to the units that correspond completely to the randomized experiment.
-	Fisher started from the following proposition: considering randomization as a prerequisite for probabilistic treatment of results is not the same as recognizing that without randomization an experiment is of little value regardless of subsequent treatment. Therefore, independently of Neyman's work, Fisher (1925) proposed the physical randomization of units and furthermore developed a distinct method of inference based for this special class of assignment mechanisms, that is, random experiments.
