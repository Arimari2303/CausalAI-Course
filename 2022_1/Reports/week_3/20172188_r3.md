## I. Research Proposal

The paper sets out its basic framework for causal inference in which it discusses potential outcomes, each corresponding to a level of treatment or manipulation; the need and usefulness of the stability assumption for examining the presence of multiple units; and the central role of the assignment mechanism. To this end, the author in his first chapter shows evidence of the problem in the informal inferences we usually make; in the second, he explains the work of other authors (Rubin, Neyman and Fisher) who provide different methods to solve or diminish the problem of causal inference. 

## II. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering the question

A strength that is present in the paper is the examples that help to understand and graph the problems of causality when stating a causal fact. In addition, the contrast it makes by mentioning the different reasons why an event occurs versus the commonly accepted reason helps the reader to understand its research problem. Another strength, present in the second chapter, is to mention the research of other authors on the problem of causal inference. This provides greater assurance to the reader/researcher that the article's proposition is supported. The weakness of the article may be in the lack of conclusions through mathematics or evidence of impacts due to lack of "causality".

## III. Contribution of the paper/ Reason for publication.

I find the chapters useful for researchers seeking to find the reason for certain events, as it helps them to consider other events that are sometimes not counted because of the researcher's bias. The article also reminds researchers that their research may be limited, and it is necessary to be honest with the reader. On the other hand, the article may also be useful for people who are not necessarily economists (politician, doctor, person without a university education, etc. ....) who tend to make informal inferences that are not necessarily true and who tend to rely on the past to support it, as it would help them to reconsider the other options. 

## IV. Next steps to advance the question

The author could assess the impacts of errors in causal inference problems on estimation and prediction.
