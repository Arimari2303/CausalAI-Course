## What is the research question of the article ?

* The article seeks to develop a frame of reference on causality; it talks about how causality is commonly used by people making informal inferences, which is only part of everything causality itself is. The implicit question of the article is how to define causality and what aspects should be considered. 

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

*   The advantages of the article is that it proposes examples to explain causality, the most didactic example was that of taking or not an aspirin to relieve headache is key because through it it explains the issues related to causality: potential results respective to each decision, the importance of follow-up in multiple individuals and the way in which these are treated. In addition, it gives a space to an article to develop each feature emphasizing that certain characteristics are not always met, such as the fact that the observation units are not related (SUTVA section). Another advantage of the article is that it places equations to explain more about the subject and not stay only in textual theory. Another advantage of the article is that it places equations to explain more about the subject and not stay only in textual theory. A disadvantage that the article could have is that it does not place an empirical example of causality product of an experimental exercise as there are varied in the literature. 

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  Beyond the fact that the article is a frame of reference to explain causality, it provides intuition of the basic conditions when you want to study regressions between variables, but the article does not mention it because it tries not to address much technicality as it demonstrated by placing everyday examples; it is a good article for that reader who likes inferential statistics and wants to learn more about the real effect of some variables on others. 

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  In general, the article is very good, some recommendation would be to place tables with some empirical results on the effects of two decisions as in the example of headache relief taking or not taking an aspirin or some similar example not so exhaustive, but that does help to better understand causality.
