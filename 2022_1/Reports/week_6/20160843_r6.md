1.  What is the research question of the article?

The authors study a new framework for identifying standard errors in the presence of clustered observations, given that, as they show, neither the so called clustered standard errors and the robust standard errors are appropriate in a framework which clustering adjustment matters.


2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper approach to responding to that question?

An important strength of the article is that it presents a new framework of understanding cluster adjustment to standard errors, that can incorporate previous adjustment procedures as special cases of that new framework. The authors also show relevant statistical properties (e.g. asymptotic variance) of this new cluster adjustment procedure, while incorporating two new variance estimators (CCV and TSCB). Besides, by proposing a new framework for understanding standard errors, the authors clarifying some missconceptions around when to cluster, both in predictive and causal effect inference. Something crucial about the paper is that itgoes beyond the theoretical ground, and in this regard analyzes the relationship between college attendance and individual earnings, with two specifications, where the college attendance (regressor) is measured as i. a  an average of attendance at the state level and ii. college attendance at individual level, using a sample from the 2000 U.S. decennial census.


3. How do the paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and the referees decided to publish the articles).

The paper proposes and justifies the use of an intermediate approach in situations where adjustment for clustering is needed (specifically, when  causal variables are imperfectly correlated within clusters), given the two common approaches: robust SE and clustered SE. This new approach to clustering has the advantage of additionally focusing of the possible variation in the treatment assignment across observations. To make this possible, they build on the precedent framework of Abadie et al. (2020), but allowing for clustering in the sampling and assignment processes. 
Another important step taken by the authors consists in deriving large sample variances, that consider variation both from sampling and assignment procedures, and comparing it in terms of magnitude with the robust SE and clustered SE. Finally, a new variance estimator is proposed, which has the characteristic feature of being relevant in contexts where the robust or clustered variances are not appropriate, as well as in intermediate contexts. 


4. What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

There are a number of issues not addressed in the paper. The authors document that, for example, the dependence structure in the assignment process calls for the use of multi-level clustering adjustments. Besides that, other estimators, such as inverse-variance weighted combinations of the estimators, may have better properties than the OLS and fixed effect estimators. In this regard, a valuable next step resides in trying to extend this framework using the former estimators.
