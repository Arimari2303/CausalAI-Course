## What is the research question of the article ?

* The research question of the article is : When you should adjust standard error for clustering ? 

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

*  Strengths: the authors propose new variance estimators to deal with intermediate settings where conventional cluster standard errors are unnecessarily conservative and robust standard errors are too small, also they limit that if the clustering adjustment matters, in the sense that the cluster standard errors are substantially larger than the robust standard errors, one should use the cluster standard errors, then the article show the results of a empirical exercise that includes more than 2 million of individuals and it were contrast with a bootstrap variant results. 

* Weaknesses: it was necessary to make a small emphasis that clustering is the beginning of a series of evaluations, simulations and processes to make the most of this matching learning tool.

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  The document contribute with a novel framework for clustering for the analysis of regression estimators from a design perspective, also it  derives the large sample variances, that take into account variation both from sampling and assignment, for the least squares and the fixed effect estimators and it propose a new variance estimator, the Causal Cluster Variance (CCV). 

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  Study how the coefficients or estimators are unbiased and have minimum variance when doing many simulations or in what type of data it is better to use this tool (nominal, in levels, indices, rates, etc.)
