## Research question
The research question is the following: How to estimate heterogeneous causal effects in experimental and observational studies?

## Strengths and weaknesses of the paper to answering the research question
The partition approach of the authors allows to work with many covariates (attributes) related to the number of units observed. Besides, the "honest" model allows to get a valid confidence intervals for treatments effects without the need of "sparsity" assumptions. An honest model does not use the same information for the selection of the model structure and the estimation given this structure as other models that are "adaptive".

About the weaknesses, the authors mention that there is a trade-off. On the one hand, there is a loss of precision from dividing the sample. However, on the other hand, we find a benefit in doing this, since it allows to eliminate the bias.

## Contribution of the paper to solve the research question
The paper offers some methods to estimate heterogeneity in causal effect in experimental and observational studies. Besides, it proposes an approach based on data-driven to partition the data into subpopulations (training, estimation, testing). In this case, the training sample is divided into two parts. The first one is to construct the tree and the second one is to estimate the effects of the treatment whithin the leaves of the tree.

The study also compares its model to others which focus on goodness of fit in model selection. The authors care to reduce the MSE of treatment effects, but there is the "fundamental problem of causal individual". That is, it is not possible to see the causal effect for any individual unit  . Regarding this, they proposes an approach for unbiased estimates of the MSE of causal effects of treatments. Along the same lines, the smallest MSE is obtained with the CT-H criterion.
