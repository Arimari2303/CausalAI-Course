# Report 2: Inference for High-Dimensional Sparse Econometric Models (Belloni, Chernozhukov and Hansen)

## What is the research question of the article?

The authors want to review the contexts when it is possibly to use High-Dimensional Sparse (HDS) regressions to obtain the most-approximate parameters to the "real" ones of the model in question. To explain this, the authors discuss the application of non-parametric models in datasets that have more information than needed in an Ordinary Least Square model. The result of regressing a non-parametric model using ℓ1- penalization methods may give the most accurate and important estimators to explain the causality relation between the variables of interest.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?

The main strength  of the article is the use of a variaty of examples to explain the contexts where the ℓ1-penalization models can be applied, highlighting the help in empirical economic researchs, obtaining the best estimators.

The paper is a very solid research, but the main weakness is that the reader needs a strong statistical and econometric knowledge if they want a fluid reading.

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, it does. This collection of empirical examples encourage researchers to apply deeper analysis in their works using this modern model as an start. This kind of papers is what is needed to start a revolution in empirical economic research using modern technology and models to obtain better results than before.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

The next steps would be adding more models where HDS are used for economic researchs. These tools will be helpful in the future, and may be a standard knowledge for economic researchers in a few years.
