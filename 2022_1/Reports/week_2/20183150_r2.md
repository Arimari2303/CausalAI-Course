## What is the research question of the article ?

* The article discuss the way how stimate the high dimensional sparse (HDS) regression models in econometrics because this type of model assume that exist a very parsimonious group of regresors but unknowledge of identify them. Also, the article enhaces that the way how identify this regresor`s aproximations could be low efficient. One of the question of the article is if the "exact or approximate HDS models make sense in econometric applications? ", this include the way how to estimate and if make sense in economic science because one reason to not find regresors is the interpretation of the investigator in the predicticion of an event.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

* The strengths of the article is that explains the motivation in resolve the problem of HDS models in econometrics, i mean, the models with a big numbers of regresor and medium or small group of observations. Also, the article put notation before all the equations and not in the midle of these to explain easily its argument. Then the article include theoretical and empirical examples resolving the equations step by step. By other side, the article don't has many waeknesses, maybe the ampliation of equations and math makes the lecture of the article slow for someone that are begining in the econometric area. 

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  The contribution is that the article explains in what  kind of models, the absence of regresors could be fixed, and in what moments not; also, explains mathematically the lasso characteristicis of the example models to minimize the searching of regresor's aproximations. Another contribution its that the authors put other authors investigations to emphasize the main idea and make a current literature review. In general, show a guide to the correct use of experimental variables. 

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  In general, the article its very good because answer the research question and , like its authors said, that it could be extended adding " data in cases in which scores are not independent across observations which is a much-considered case in economics".
