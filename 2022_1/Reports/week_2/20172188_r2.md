# Report II

## I. Research Question 

The paper discusses the estimation and inference methods of high-dimensional models. It makes a comparison between them to identify the set of regressors and estimate the coefficients. 

## II. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach

The strength that the paper has is the demonstration of different methods to find the best estimation. In addition, it is useful for the understanding of the audience to evaluate each model and explain its efficiency as this supports your research question. Another strength is to mention the shortcomings of economics when analyzing high dimensional data with weak signals as it increases curiosity for the reader and hones the weakness of the estimation in those cases.  The weakness could be that he could have expanded the appendix a better mathematical explanation of the equations or models he used and could increase the empirical examples and exemplify the impact of prediction error.

## III. Contribution/ Motive

It helps any researcher who is not sure if his explanatory variables are the only ones or if he knows of the existence of other explanatory variables but does not know what they are. It also contributes by demonstrating that penalty methods can be useful in high-dimensional models. On the other hand, making the extension of the typical estimation method for these models is useful for further research.

## IV. Next valuable steps to advance the question

It would be interesting to find the difference between one estimation and another in real cases and see what the impact of the error is. In addition, the authors propose to review other research methods; these could be reviewed.
