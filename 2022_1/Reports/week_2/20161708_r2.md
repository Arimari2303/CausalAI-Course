# Report NÂ°2: Inference for high-dimensional sparse econometric models
## 1. Research question
According to the paper, the research question would be the following: What are the most suitable estimation methods for high dimensional sparse regression models in econometrics?

## 2. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper to answering the research question

The study illustrates that sparse methods can be useful to work with the classic Angrist and Krueger(1991)'s instrumental variables estimation because it's problematic to use many instruments and Lasso helps to choose which instruments are the best.

Regarding the weaknesses, the author mentions there are several estimators that make use of penalization, for instance, the Dantzig method. However, the examples given only use Lasso method.

## 3. Contribution of the paper to solve the research question

The paper presents inference results for instrumental variables model and the partially linear model. It shows applications, for example, to returns schooling and growth regression. Lasso instrument selection is possible and get good estimates without the need of ex ante information about the relevance of the instruments. 

## 4. Next steps to move this question forward

According to the author, it would be interesting to consider others methods instead of l-penalization to estimate models with high-dimensional data. Besides, next steps include expanding HDS models to other types of economic models and study high-dimensional data when the scores in the sup-score test are not independent across observations.
