####What is the research question of the article?

This article discusses a variety of methods for dealing with large databases where the number of regressor available are relatively large to the number of observations. This situation is common in economic research thus it demands to impose some regularization on the estimation problem. This paper explores the viability of High Dimensional Sparse Models (HDS) to del with this problem since HDS allows to capture the main features of the regression function and find and approximation to the right set of regressors. The article focuses on methods for identifying this set of regressors and estimating their coefficients based on â„“1-penalization.

####What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

One of the strengths of the article is the rigorous use of theorical literature. The authors cite and explain a vast majority of approaches in the field of econometrics and explain their limitations and assumptions. Furthermore, the authors applied the models to empirical data to prove the viability of the models. Finally, they show that Lasso-Based sparse approximations fit better in comparison with traditional modelling used in empirical economics.  The article might be seen as a literature review with some empirical applications.

On the other hand, this article might be complex and difficult to fully grasp especially for readers with basic econometrics and statistical knowledge. For instance, the literature robustness and model explanations might decrease readability at least for the first sections of the article. 

####How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)

This article contributes in the classification and comparison of models to show which performs better in each scenario. It also explores the scenario with Instrumental Variables.  The paper applies modern methods which would have been difficult to replicate years ago. 

####What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

Some future additional steps for this question are related to extending HDS models and methods to other types of economic models beyond those considered in the article. Also, it is noted that it would be interesting to consider efficient use of high-dimensional data in cases in which scores are not independent across observations.
