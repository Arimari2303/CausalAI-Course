# Report 9: Estimating treatment effects with causal forest: an application (Chernozhukuv et al.)

## What is the research question of the article?
The author want to demonstatrate the usefulness of a new approach of estimation for Machine Learning (ML) method: Double or Debiased ML. The main reason for the formulation of this method is to remove the bias from the variable of interest (${\theta_0}$) when standard ML is applied. 

By imposing 2 new instructions, we can obtain a better estimator $\widecheck{\theta_0}$ : 
- Use Neyman-orthogonal moments to reduce the correlation with covariates that increases the estimator bias. Now, the estimator is normally distributed and consistent.
- Use cross-fitting for split the data. It is useful to remove bias from the estimation, and also, by re-estimating using other samples, it is possible to recapture the efficency for the estimator $\widecheck{\theta_0}$.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?
The main strength is the use of three examples that allow us to understand the usefulness of the DML estimation.
One weakness is the amount of heavy mathematical and statistical therems that could be hard to read.


## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?
Yes, it does. It contributes giving a new approach for semi-parametrics estimators using ML. 

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?
As the other papers, the next steps would be more researchs in order to confirm the usefulness of the estimations obtained by DML.
