1. What is the research question of the article?

The article tries to study inference on low-dimensional parameters, in a context of high dimensional nuisance parameters. In this context, the authors rely on Machine Learning methods to estimate these nuisance parameters, while dealing with the bias caused by regularization and overfitting on the parameter of interest \alpha_0.

2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

One of the main strengths of the document is precisely going beyond what the traditional framework assumes regarding the complexity of the nuisance parameters. By relaxing this assumption and considering that the entropy of the nuisance parameters space increase with the sample size, the authors support the idea of bias in the inference of the parameter of interest, and novelty improve it, by using Neyman-Orthogonal moments/scores with reduced sensitivity to the estimated nuisance parameters, and by applying  "cross-fitting" to the sample. Besides that, the authors give support to their findings by mathematically showing the steps involved in it, as well as proving the benefits from applying the double/debiased machine learning to a series of examples. Regarding this last part, the authors conclude that the choice on the specific ML method (Ridge, Lasso, neural nets or Random Forests) does not substantively change the inference  on the parameters, giving extra support to their methodology.

NOTE: Cross fitting implies swaping the role of the main and auxiliary sample to obtain two estimations of the parameter of interest, and then
averaging them, in the context of sample splitting.

3. How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The main contribution of the document is, as the authors state, to estimate and perfom inference on a parameter of interest (usually a treatment effect) in a context of high dimensional nuisance parameters.

4. What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

Other relevant steps to move forward on answering this question is to apply DML method to a broader set of examples in the academy, in order to fully prove that this methodology can actually give consistent and similar results independently on the specific ML method chosen.
