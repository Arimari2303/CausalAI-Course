The research question posed by the author in this article is whether the standard Mincer earnings equation presented in the publication of Education, Experience and Earnings continues to be a reference model thirty years after the publication mentioned above. This is due to new knowledge created in the labor economics literature, new estimation techniques, and better access to microdata during this period.

To answer this question, the author focused on reviewing the literature with results that may have some implication for the choice of a precise "reference point". However, I consider that this is not enough to be able to determine if the basic Mincer human capital earnings continues to be a reference for the determination of human capital earnings. From my point of view, it is necessary to provide scientific knowledge. For example, to complement the literature review, the Mincer equation could have been used with statistical data collected since the 2000s, in order to verify whether the conclusions obtained, such as, for example, that the experience-salary profiles do not fit the simple Mincer model, causing the wage gap between College students with more experience and High School students with less experience to increase, because the relative supply of highly educated workers has not kept pace with the relative demand, continues to be true for the new millennium. It is important to study the case raised, since since the 2000s, most countries have implemented regulations that oblige their citizens to complete elementary and middle school, have allocated most of the budget to improving state education, have granted scholarships to access higher education, among other reforms.

However, this does not imply that the document has not contributed any knowledge. This article highlights the need to re-evaluate the standard Mincer earnings equation, which has been used in several studies, including new knowledge generated over 30 years. In addition, within their findings, the basic Mincer earnings model continues to be a good reference as long as there is a stable environment where educational achievement grows without problems in all cohorts of individuals throughout the life cycle. Yet, as mentioned above, this conclusion should have been verified for cohorts from 1995 to 2005, due to the new conditions of the decade.

Another contribution of the document is that the simple earnings function can be adjusted according to the needs of the researcher to avoid overstate or understate the effect of experience and education on the earnings of some groups by, for example, adding higher order polynomials (up to a quartic) for potential experience, of quadratic polynomials in terms of years of schooling in order to capture the increasing convexity of the schooling-wages relationship and allow cohort effects to capture returns of education among cohorts born after 1950.

Regarding the next steps to be taken, it is proposed :(1) Collect even more empirical evidence (and if possible scientific knowledge) carried out during 2000, 2010 and 2020. Especially during this last period, since it is important to include the effect of COVID-19 within the simple Mincer human capital earnings function. As a proposal, this effect can be introduced through the years of schooling in virtual education, since it is possible that it could have some effect on the salaries earned by College (and High School) graduates who adopted the virtual education modality and (2) further fine-tuning  the standard Mincer earnings formula by incorporating emotional intelligence and soft skills, which, despite being a qualitative variable, can be introduced due to advances in Behavioral Economics. Thus, individuals who have a greater number of soft skills can obtain better jobs within different companies or institutions, achieving higher incomes.
