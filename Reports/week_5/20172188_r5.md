# I. Research proposal
Both articles aim to provide options for solving variable choice problems. They show the problems of
reducing or adding variables and the existence of covariates that perturb econometric models. They use
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and double machine learning (DML).
# II. Strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering the question
The strength of both authors is that they start by explaining the problem, then explain how the different
techniques will be used to choose variables to either remove or add. They then add examples from
everyday life and explain the results. Doing this procedure is beneficial for the person interested in the
topic as it makes it easier to understand the article; moreover, it can convince that these methods are
useful or necessary. It should be noted that the authors are also honest with the audience by highlighting
the limits of the methods and what can be done in cases of bias. As weaknesses could be in the complex
models in Double Machine Learning and Automated Confounder Selection - A Cautionary Tale, I think they
could be better explained as it may give the impression that some researcher with little econometric
knowledge can understand. On the other hand, the text of A Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls could
extend its explanation of the models in the graphs so that they can be better supported.
# III. Contribution of the document/ Reason for publication
The contribution of the paper is that it is useful for researchers to better find the causal variables in their
research topic. Given that there is a wide range of possibilities for why an event can occur and that
sometimes the same event can be explained by different reasons, it is important to know how to select
the variables with which the regression will be performed in order not to fall into bias or omission of
variables. In my opinion, I believe that the reason why these articles have been published is because of
the variety of errors in estimators from different research. I also think it is because researchers can be
influenced by their beliefs when choosing variables and need a method that reveals which variables may
be affecting their hypothesis.
# IV. Next steps to advance the question
The authors of Double Machine Learning and Automated Confounder Selection - A Cautionary Tale
should explain a bit more the model of bad controls especially the graphs, explain a real life example
and add a conclusion. While the authors of A Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls can better explain
the graphs as well.
