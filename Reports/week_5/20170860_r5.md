# Report 5 (Hunermund and Cinelli)

## What is the research question of the article?

Both papers make the question of how and when is convienient to include control variables in a regression, from different approachs. Cinelli takes a look at directed acyclic graphs (ADGs) and how to avoid using bad controls, and Hunermund in the use of Double machine learning (DML) can be sensity when using bad controls.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?

The way both papers were written makes them very easy to understand. And also they include an appendix where the mathematical and statistical formulas are detailed. Also, the examples are useful if we want to start an empirical research to not use bad controls, Cinelli focus on linear regression and Hunermund on ML.

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, they do. The Cinelli's paper describes very well how to use Z variables (controls) in regressions to not overbias our estimations. It helps as an introduction to Hunermund paper in order to understand better the use in DML.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

Both papers are very recent, so they work well helping in empirical researchs and also expands the discussions about the use of controls in regressions, and if it is correct to use it and new approaches in those methods.
