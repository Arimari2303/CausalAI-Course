The text [1] presents graphical tools, known as direct acyclic graphs (DAG) to visualize, understand and solve the bias problem that occurs by adding a 'bad control'. Thus, the main sources of association that make up a DAG are: mediators (chain), common causes (confounders) and common effects (colliders). Its main strength is that it presents a series of illustrative examples that allow to understand the solution of bad control, which otherwise is quite a challenge even for experts. Among the main ideas he presents the following descriptions. Z is a string if X -> Z -> Y, Z is a confounder if X <- Z -> Y, while Z is a collider if X -> Z <- Y. So if we want to estimate X in Y what All you have to do is block all spurious paths between X and Y and not disturb any of the causal paths. So whether or not to include a control depends on whether that control opens a counfunder (does not add), is a mediator (does add), or a collider (does add).

The paper by Hunermund, Louw and Caspi (2022) [2] demonstrates that the Double Machine Learning (DML) tool is very sensible that bad controls are included in the covariate space. The DML is a method for selecting variables, which is based on the assumption of conditional independence. Because high-dimensional models generally include covariates that are not exogenous, the above assumption does not hold. The occurrence of bad controls causes the DML tool to have limitations to correctly choose the covariates. Likewise, the authors compare the DML method with the LASSO and show with the help of simulations that the latter is superior when the covariates are exogenous.
