## Report 5
### Article 1: Cinelli, Forney & Pearl (2022). A crash course in good and bad controls
### Article 2: Hunermund, Louw & Caspi (2022). Double Machine Learning and Automated Confounder Selection - A Cautionary Tale
#### Student: Diego Esteban Quispe - 20192073
#### - What is the research question of the article?
The first article presents a theoretical review on the use of controls, as well as the choice of controls for the regression function and overcoming the problem of omitted variables bias.
On the other hand, the second article studies the precision of double machine learning methods in the selection of variables considered as good controls.
#### - What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paperâ€™s approach to answering that question?
The strength of the first article is that it presents the difference between good control and bad control through graphs (DAGs) that allow a better understanding of causal relationships.
#### - How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
The contribution of the first article is the presentation of the literature on the choice of good controls and bad controls in a very simplified, graphic and very understandable way for researchers from other social sciences.
The contribution of the second article is the presentation of the limitations of the Double Machine Learning method, such as the lack of precision in the choice of controls in the case of collider structure, which generates bias and therefore, the good choice of controls is not ensured.
#### - What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
For the first article, I think it could be very interesting to present cases with a greater number of controls and with the analysis of more complex cases that can be found in practice.
For the second article, as the article says, the next steps in the investigation would be to review artificial intelligence methods for the automation of the choice of variables, as well as to look for a mathematical or more theoretical proof about how to overcome the problem of the choice of variables and the robustness of the method.
