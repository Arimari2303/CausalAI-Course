## What is the research question of the article ?

* The article of Cinelli, Forney and Pearl (2022) emphasizes in the problem of "bad controls" in regression models or in statistic it self, the implicit question here is : How to provide a concise, simple, and visual summary of these criteria through illustrative examples that use analysts practicers ? Whereas the article of Hünermund, Louw and Caspi (2022) is about how the metodology of machine learning can be better than other ways in regressions, the  implicit question research of this article is How machine learning give a better way to regress taking into account the bias of variables in models? 

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

*  The strengths of first article mentioned (Cinelli, Forney and Pearl ,  2022) addresses with the idea that adding more variables to a model isn't always good, returns to a base framework to explain it: describe the causal diagrams(the mediators, common causes and common effects),then use this tool to make ilustrative models: bad, good and neutral ones, also explain the "bias", that is the direction of causality of variables and the concept of "back-door path" anda overcontrol bias that could make a bad control in models; the weakness of this document its that doesn't show a empiric example of at least one topic like multiple controls or beyond adjustment. 

*  The strengths of second article mentioned (Hünermund, Louw and Caspi, 2022) is that show a comparative stimation of matchig learning against other methods highlighting advantage factors like confounder detection, direction of bias and also use a empirical example to prove it. I think the article is complete in the idea it wants to expose, so no weaknesses in it.  

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  The contribution of Cinelli, Forney and Pearl (2022) is that makes a summary of everything that must be taken into account before studying causality, describes several concepts so that the researcher gives a reference on how to intervene in his model.
 * The contribution of Hünermund, Louw and Caspi (2022) is that explain how matching learning can be used in a practice and simple way to resolve many problems that other methods can't solve.

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

* It could be interesting explain in which branch of the social sciences it is more reliable to apply matching learning beyond that it is used with big data, it could be found, for example, that in the area of finance it is better to use these methods rather than in the area of marketing or publicity.
