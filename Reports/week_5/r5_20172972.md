## 1. What is the research question of both articles?

Before to introduce the problem of omitting variables or wich variable if we included in the regression could induce to bias. Then the authors introduce us what type of variable exist (good variable and bad variables). The research question of Cinelli and others paper is which set of variables should be adjusted for to identify the causal effect of interest.Then, the autors show to the lectors the causal diagrams to reconize if the variable is good to do causal inference or not.

On the other hand, the Hunermund and others papers first introduce to the lectors the variable selection problem an some posible solutions. But, the authors emphasize that apply the solutions (double machine learning) in these problem is unconfoundedness, especially if the regression exist a set of bad control variables. With this propose theory, the research question is what are the consequences of do the double machine learning with bad control variables. However, before to answer the question the authors explain in what case we have bad control variables. 

In resume, the both papers porpuse is show how to reconize the bad and good control variables and what are the consequence to use the bad control variables with double machine learning.

## 2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of both papers' approaches to responding to that question?

The strengths of both papers to answer the question is show every possible case when exist a path between an exogenous variable and endogenous variable with graphs. Another strengths is show some real examples where exist bad and good controls, also some real examples where the control are blurred. Another strengths, in the second paper strengthen some cases with a matemathical aproach and this paper also strengthen to show us with econometric aproach an examples with real data where the controls are bad controls, also show us what method is the best solution in this cases (Lasso or double machine learning).

However, the weaknesses to answer the question in both papers exist in the second paper where the mathematical aproach and econometric aproach will be dificult to read to people who don't know this aproaches. 

## 3. How do the papers advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and the referees decided to publish the articles).

The contribution of both papers are for the researchers and some students economics. The reason is that is common to this people make errors with the control variables, especially in the last part of a research. And both pappers will be a guide to this people to do the econometric aproach in a research. 

Also, the contribution are for the politic problems. The reason is that is dificult to do a social proyect without do a minimum causal exercise with every step to do a social proyect. So, is commom that the economics do this process with econometry and also they can be guided by this pappers. 

## 4. What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

The first step to move forward on the question is evaluate another solutions like partialing out in the case that bad control variables exist in the regretion. 

Another step will be do the econometric aproach which the control variables are blurred to know what can we do in those cases.
