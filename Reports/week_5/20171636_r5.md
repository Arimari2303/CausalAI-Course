## Double Machine Learning and Automated Confounder Selection - A Cautionary Tale |  A Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls


Hunerm√ºnd, Louw and Caspi (2021)  seek to anser what are the consequences of violations of unconfoundedness for Double machine learning (DML) due to the presence of bad controls in the conditioning set? 

On the other hand, Cinelli, Forney and Pearl (2022) have as a research question how to identify if the variables added to the regression equations are good controls or bad controls?

Among the strengths of both papers is the methodology applied to answer both questions: in the first article, they present an introductory framework on machine learning approaches to select suitable control variables to establish the identification of causal parameters in high-dimensional environments and explain the theory of bad controls in regression analysis by building on the backdoor approach of the graphical causal model literature, then they focus on DML and explain the advantages of this method in choosing variables with good control to include in the causal inference compared to the LASSO method and finally, they carry out simulations and present practical examples, such as the estimation of the gender wage gap, to demonstrate its main argument, which is that including variables with poor controls can generate bias in the DML simulation.However, the weakness of this article is that it does not explain in detail how these practical applications and simulations were carried out, which limits the reader's learning when applying DML theory to practice.

As mentioned above, the second article presents a similar structure: first they define what are good and bad controls, then they give a theoretical framework and illustrative examples on directed acyclic graphs (DAG), path-blocking and backdoor paths. Finally, they present three cases of bad controls discussed in the applied research. This structure also made it easy to understand the mathematical and econometric concepts used in this article, which is why I consider its main strength. Nevertheless, a weakness that I found is that the article does not give a complete analysis of other types of variables, such as instrumental variables, which are used more frequently in impact evaluations.

The main contribution of the first article is that it explains the advantages of using DML in determining which variable is a good control, as it allows good controls to be reliably filtered from irrelevant covariates, which the Lasso method cannot do in various situations.

Regarding the second paper, the main contribution was the easy explanation of directed acyclic graphs (DAG) so that economics students, and I believe that in general any public, can identify the good and bad controls, using the theory of DAG, when performing any investigation that requires causal inference to prove its hypotheses.


The next steps to follow would be (1) to review the literature on artificial intelligence to find another alternative that generates better results than DML and (2) to investigate if DML can be applied in other specialties such as finance or social sciences to find the variables with good control.
