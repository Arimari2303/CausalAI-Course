# REPORT 01: The Mincer Equation Thirty Year After Schooling, Experience and Earnings -  Thomas Lemieux

The research question of the paper is explicitly stated by the author with the following question: "How does the Mincer equation stand in light of all theseadvances in empirical labor economics?"

In order to answer such question, this article evaluates the components of the Mincer equation one by one. His particular effort shows strenghts and weaknesses, which we'll annnounce throughtout this brief report. On the one hand, the article's explanatory strengths are the following. First, the author, as mentioned, establish analytics segments corresponding to each one of the components of the Mincer model, namely wages, education and experience. This brings a good order of analysis. In addition, this also makes possible a) a detail revision of each component —considering contributions to date, which try different algebraic structure and different datasets available in differente regiones and periods of time—, and b) the statement of —also previously posed— relationships between the components taken into account (wages, education and experience). Second, and in a tight-knit relation with the analysis of the applicability of the Mincer equation in differents periods of times, the author adds modifications to the Mincer equation's structure to take into account the variably behaviour of each of the variables analyzed in the regression. I have not considered properly the weaknesses of the author's analytical approach, so I'll refrain from writing on that point.
