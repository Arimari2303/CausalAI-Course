# REPORT 1
## Author: Kenia Moscoso 

## What is the research question of the article? 
\
From the sum of a linear function of main regressors of the Mincer equation (years of schooling, years of potencial market experience and a quadratic years of potencial market experience), where the endogenous determinant is the log wage. The author try to dispute this regressors (why this regressors has some properties in relation of log wage? will it be different in the passage of time? will it be different with another persons samples?) to reappraise the Mincer earnings equation nowadays.  \
The authors hypothesis is the properties between the regressors and the endogenous must of the time change when we use another persons samples or another time. 
\

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strengths to answering the research question are the paper's wich the author quoted to dispute the relation between the regressors and the endogenous of the Mincer equation. Because this paper's tends to the author to reappraise the Mincer equation nowadays with some modifications like change one of the regressors to the quartic years of potencial market experience and add another regressor like the cohort effect. Also dispute the properties between regressors and the endogenous helps. 
\
\
The weaknesses is find paper's appraise the Mincer equation just from United State or developed countries. I think the question will be consistent answered if the author include those paper's. \
Another weaknesses is that the authors try to force to show us how the Mincer equation change when the samples are modified. I say that the authors try to force the reappraise for the reason that they don't use a actual sample where the regression properties from the origin Mincer equation (this samples exist) \
In general, the main weaknesses is the lack of actual samples to show us more knowledge about the research question. 
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
The authors decided to publish the article to show that the Mincer equation nowadays has changes because all the regressors has changed for several changed in diferents important periods (5 or 3 years periods that the authors usually divide to see the changes more specifically). I believe that the authors try to choose periods where there was an important international event. Also, their contribute to the Mincer equation literature. 
\
\
## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
It will be usefull to go deeper into why the authors of the paper's choose some years periods to put in context. As well, the next step to move forward will be choose another actual paper's from countries with diferent economic system to go deeper into the research question and to expand the knowledge.
