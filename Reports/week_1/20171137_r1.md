In the work of Lemieux (2006), the research question is how the Mincer equation is stand considering advances in labor economics, since not only have technological advances been made, but microdata has expanded. Along the same lines, the author wonders if it is time to review the benchmark model.

Regarding the strengths of the document to answer the research question, it is observed that the author analyzes in detail each element of the standard Mincer equation. In addition, it not only shows the changes that have taken place but as mentioned in his work, it specifies the implications of a few recent studies in choosing an accurate benchmark. For example, it shows that the linear specification of education can be inexact. In sum, he proposes the inclusion of a quadratic term in years of schooling to capture the growing convexity in the relationship between schooling and wages.

Regarding the weaknesses, it is found that the author only focuses on the issue of the robustness of Mincerâ€™s original specification. However, it does not cover much broader literature on earnings determination. For example, an issue that has gained more visibility over the years is the impact of gender on individuals' perception of income. There is also the effect of public policies on income and employment, state interventions (educational programs, subsidies, etc.), among others. All these issues can also affect the robustness of the Mincer standard specification. However, it is an area that is not covered in the paper.

The main contribution of the paper is the conclusion that, even after thirty years, the Mincer equation remains a useful and accurate benchmark for estimating wage determination equations provided if the model fits in three points. First, a quartic function must be included in the potential experience instead of just a quadratic function. Second, education should be allowed to be captured through a quadratic term so that it captures the increasing convexity in the relationship between schooling and earnings. Third, allowing for cohort effects to capture the dramatic growth in returns to schooling among cohorts born after 1950.

Finally, two additional steps are rescued to advance with the answer to the research question posed. The first step is to counteract the limitation that has been found. In other words, work must be done in the field of income determination. The second step is the constant review of the implications of the advances on the robustness of the original specification.
