Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Structural Parameters

The paper is about is classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low dimensional parameter θ in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η. To estimate η, the paper considers the use of statistical or machine learning methods which are particularly well-suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. So, the paper’s research question is how to obtain consistent and valid estimations of interest parameters in the presence of high-dimensional by using machine learning. It searches how these methods can the complexity of annoyance parameters and improve causal inference. 

There are some strengths of the paper. It uses ML methods and robust estimation techniques to reach a better precision. Nuisance parameter estimation: Methods such as random forests, lasso and neural networks are used and this let us manage many covariates without losing precision. Furthermore, DML allows obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects by controlling confounding variables. Another way would be using cross fitting that improves the efficiency of the estimators by using different partitions of data to learn the nuisance functions. Also, we can talk about robust inference where it establishes some theorical conditions: convergence of annoyance parameters and Neyman orthogonality. However, there are some weaknesses. The lack of the orthogonality condition that limits results and dependence on positive constants tending to zero that was mentioned in the context of parameter estimators. In cross-fitting, splitting the sample as time series, independence between samples cannot be guaranteed, which can lead to biases in estimates and poor generalization of results. Also, there are some computational problems, because of data sets, multiple adjustments and cross-validation.

Article develops DML by using machine learning techniques to model and control confounding variables. So, it shows how DML can be applied to different contexts like estimation of average treatment effects (ATE) and average treatment effects in the treated (ATT), by providing a theoretical framework that guarantees the validity of statistical inferences. In fact, by showing applicability of DML, article suggests that this method can be used to evaluate impact of different interventions and programs getting better decisions based on evidence.

Next steps in the paper would be to develop exploration of the robustness of DML estimators in different model configurations and assumptions, as well as the evaluation of their performance in high-dimensionality contexts. Furthermore, the need to further investigate the asymptotic properties of DML estimators and their applicability in situations where regularity conditions may not be met is suggested like developing cross-fitting in time series as I mentioned.
