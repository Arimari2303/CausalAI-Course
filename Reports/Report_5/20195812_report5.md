The paper works on the methods to make reliable inferences about low - dimensional parameters of interest ( treatment affects ) in the presence of high dimensional nuisance parameters. This paper introduces the method called Double Machine Learning, A methodology that combines machine learning techniques with econometric inference to provide unbiased and root consistent estimates of these parameters. The article analyzes the classical problem of semiparametric inference for low-dimensional parameter. The paper proposes double or debiased ML to addres the bias problem. DML should employ two things, Neyman orthogonal moments or scores and Cross - fitting. The autor use some examples like teh reexamination of Acemoglu´s estimation of institutions economic growth.

The main strength relies in combining Neyamn orthogonal and cross - fitting, enabling the use of a wide range of machine learning methods to estimate nuisance parameters while maintaining uniform asymptotic validity and robust inference. DML’s flexibility allows the research activity to leverage the power ot modern methods, as we have seen in the several lecture of this course. DML demonstrates broad applicability across various models, including partially linear regression, instrumental models an treatment effect models. 

In order, and despite DML’s robustness to bias, the accuracy of parameter of interes estimatio remains dependen on the quality of nuisance parameter estimation. The implementation of DML, particularly with cross - fitting and multiple sample splis could be computationally intensive. These could be hard to put in practice for the majority of researches who have recently learnt these kind of techniques. While DML guarantees consistency and asumptotyc normality, achieving semiparametric efficiency requires additional assumptions, such as the choice of efficiente score function. The article provides empircal examples but more studies are need to fully understan DMLs performance across a broader range of applications

The article makes significant contribution to the field. The innovation lies in the development of DML method. I will address three lines of contributions that are very valuable for the DML. The opportunity of overocming traditional method limitations, because of the inability of classical methods to handle high dimensional scenarios. The formalization of the debiasing concept. DML provides a solid framework for debiasing estimators in semiparametic problems. For the end, flexibility in ML method selections. DML allows the use of a wide range of ML techniques, adapting to data complexity.

The application of DML in Latin American and Peruvian social sciences context presents both opportunities and challenges. In these regions, where data quality and availability often vary significantly, DML's robustness to high-dimensional nuisance parameters could be particularly valuable for studying complex social phenomena such as inequality, informal economy, or educational outcomes.
