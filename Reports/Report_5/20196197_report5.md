**Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Structural Parameters**

The article _Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Structural Parameters_ addresses an important problem, the main question of this article would be how to make robust inferences with highly complex covariates, using machine learning methods without compromising the statistical validity of the results? This is an important advance to face situations where the data used are highly complex. The authors of the article show us the Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) method, this method combines Neyman-orthogonal moments with cross-fitting.

The authors indicate that machine learning methods (Random Forests or Lasso) despite handling high dimensions, introduce biases in the estimates. In view of this, the DML method presents strengths, as already mentioned before, that make it stand out compared to previous methods. Among them is the ability to handle high-dimensional bases through machine learning to estimate situations where interactions are not evident. Using Neyman-orthogonal moments ensures that regularization bias does not contaminate the final estimate, even when the nuisance parameters are highly complex. They show that it is not just about the biases that come with using machine learning methods, but also allows for valid inferences with consistent and efficient estimators.

It should be considered, but not ruled out, that the DML method is weak in its high computational complexity, as crossfitting requires multiple splits and adjustments of the model, which can be prohibitive in large databases. In addition, the possibility of empirical limitations of the DML method will be in real-world scenarios with extremely imbalanced data, non-standard distributions, or severe multicollinearity issues.

The contribution of the authors of the article is that the DML approach makes a contribution to the field of causal inference by offering a general framework that can effectively adapt the strengths of machine learning with the validity we want from econometric inference. The authors fill this gap by developing a methodology that not only allows for unbiased and consistent estimation of key parameters in high-dimensional contexts. To further advance and support the research objective, empirical validation could be extended using the DML approach in complex real-world applications and recognize possible limitations that have not yet been identified.
