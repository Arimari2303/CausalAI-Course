This paper seeks to answer how to make valid inferences about low-dimensional parameters in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters that can be estimated using machine learning methods. To address this, it introduces a new methodology called Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML).
This methodology has several strengths. The first strength is the combination of two useful elements. The first one is the Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores, which ensure that estimation errors of high-dimensional nuisance parameters do not bias the estimation of the low-dimensional parameters of interest , which are the focus of the investigation. The second element is cross-fitting  which is an efficient data splitting method.This reduces the probability  of overfitting and improves the reliability of the inference. The second strength is its flexibility. Due to its minimal theoretical requirements, the DML methodology can be applied with a wide range of machine learning models, including random forests, lasso, ridge regression, deep neural networks, boosted trees, and others.The third strength is the use of three real-world examples based on the replication of three previous investigations, but now using DML. These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and show how DML performs in real-life scenarios and in different estimation models, demonstrating its potential and applicability.
Despite these strengths, the methodology has some weaknesses. Its success heavily depends on the machine learning models used to estimate the nuisance parameters. If the selected model is poorly specified or underperforms, the inference can be unreliable, undermining the methodâ€™s robustness.
The contribution of this article is significant. It introduces an innovative and robust method that allows for more accurate inference by eliminating annoying variable bias. The article explains its assumptions and procedures, providing both theoretical foundations and practical demonstrations. Additionally, empl has examples that are directly comparable to previous studies. This improves confidence and provides a more concrete explanation of the methodology explained as well as its applicability.An important next step is to apply and test this method in new research contexts and datasets. that  would help to refine the methodology  and amplify its utility in various scenarios .
