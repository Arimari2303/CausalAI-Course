This article examines the increasing complexity of data that poses significant challenges for the accurate estimation of treatment effects and structural parameters in the current context of social and economic sciences. According to the author, these problems are aggravated when the analysis involves a large number of control variables, known as nuisance parameters, whose high dimensionality and complexity make statistical inference difficult. This essay addresses these challenges from the perspective of the Double / Debiased Machine Learning (DML) approach , a methodology that combines machine learning tools with robust statistical principles to ensure consistent and efficient estimates. In this way, this approach not only mitigates biases generated by regularization and overfitting, but also provides a flexible framework for data analysis in complex semiparametric environments .
Therefore, this research aims to answer the question of how to perform valid and efficient inference on a parameter of interest in a semiparametric model where the nuisance parameters are high-dimensional and estimated by machine learning. To this end, the hypothesis, which we work on in the following essay, based on the article , argues that the DML approach offers a robust methodological solution, overcoming the limitations of traditional models and addressing key gaps in the literature. First, because this method allows estimating highly complex nuisance parameters, avoiding the constraints of limited complexity that classical semiparametric models usually impose . Second, it employs Neyman orthogonal moments and the cross-fitting technique to mitigate the biases associated with the use of machine learning, a problem that other approaches have not satisfactorily resolved. Because of this, the article , provides a unified framework applicable to various models, such as partially linear regressions, treatment effects analysis, and instrumental variable models, highlighting its theoretical and practical versatility.


This essay is structured in three main parts. The first examines the theoretical foundations of the DML approach, exploring how it combines machine learning and statistics to address complex inference problems. The second part analyses the gaps in the literature that this approach seeks to fill, including the limitations of traditional semiparametric models and the problems of bias in previous methods. Finally, the third section presents a critical analysis of its applicability in different contexts, highlighting its methodological contributions. Finally, the implications of the DML approach for the advancement of econometrics and its potential to meet the challenges that arise in the era of complex data are reflected upon.
Double / Debiased Machine Learning (DML) methodology starts with a clear definition of the estimation problem, focusing on a parameter of interest, which depends on a set of control variables (X) and, potentially, endogenous variables. From a data set composed of independent and identically distributed observations, a function is established that describes the relationship between these variables. In this context, a central aspect of DML is the estimation of the so-called nuisance parameters , which, although they are not the main focus of the analysis, significantly affect the accuracy of the estimation of the target parameter. For this, machine learning tools such as Lasso, decision trees, Random Access Memory (RAM) and others are used. Forests and neural networks, which are especially useful for addressing high dimensionality and complex relationships between variables.

A key feature of DML is the use of orthogonal Neyman moments , which contribute to reducing the bias in the estimates by ensuring that they are less sensitive to errors in the estimation of the nuisance parameters . This is achieved by constructing orthogonal estimators, specifically designed to mitigate the influence of these parameters on the final estimate. Furthermore, the methodology incorporates the cross-fitting technique , a procedure that divides the dataset into subsets and uses each of them alternately to estimate the nuisance parameters and evaluate the parameter of interest. This approach not only improves the robustness of the estimates, but also minimizes the risk of overfitting, a common problem in machine learning-based methods.
Once the nuisance parameters have been estimated, the parameter of interest is calculated by integrating these estimates into the corresponding equations. This step allows obtaining an adjusted and reliable estimate of the target parameter. Subsequently, DML provides tools to perform statistical inferences, such as constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests. The asymptotic properties of the estimators guarantee their consistency and approximate normality, which reinforces the validity of the inferences. Finally, the methodology underlines the importance of validating the results by comparing different machine learning methods, assessing robustness against alternative specifications of the model, and verifying the stability of the estimates in various partitions of the data.


Furthermore , the paper presents a remarkable methodological innovation by introducing a generic and flexible framework based on the debiased machine learning ( DML) approach. This method combines modern machine learning tools with classical statistical principles, such as Neyman orthogonality and cross-fitting , allowing to obtain efficient and approximately unbiased estimates. The flexibility of the approach makes it applicable to a wide variety of machine learning methods, such as random forests , lasso , and neural networks, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods for analyzing complex and high-dimensional data. Furthermore, the theoretical rigor of the article is noteworthy, as it establishes a solid mathematical basis to demonstrate the consistency of the estimators, their convergence to root-N rate, and their asymptotic normality. This, in turn, allows valid confidence intervals to be constructed, increasing the reliability of the method. The proposed theory is effectively generalized to diverse contexts, being applied to models such as partially linear regressions, instrumental variable analysis, and estimates of average treatment effects, which demonstrates its versatility.
However, the approach has certain weaknesses. One of the main limitations is its computational complexity, since the use of advanced machine learning techniques, combined with data partitioning processes such as cross -fitting , significantly increases the processing and data handling requirements. Furthermore, although it relaxes some traditional assumptions, the method still depends on machine learning models meeting certain convergence rates and on the sample size being large enough to avoid bias and overfitting problems. The practical implementation of the approach can also be challenging, since it is sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters , the specific machine learning techniques employed, and the design of the data partitioning procedure. Finally, although the paper includes illustrative examples, empirical validation in more diverse and complex contexts still seems limited, which might restrict its practical applicability in certain areas.
The text makes a fundamental contribution by addressing a classical problem in statistical inference: the estimation of low-dimensional parameters, represented as θ0\theta_0 θ0 , in contexts where the nuisance parameters ( η0\eta_0 η0 ) are highly complex and of high dimensionality . To solve this difficulty, a methodological framework called Double / Debiased Machine Learning (DML) is proposed . This approach combines modern machine learning tools with robust statistical principles, achieving consistent and efficient estimates even in complex and high dimensionality settings .
Regarding the gaps in the literature, the paper overcomes several limitations of traditional semiparametric models , which typically assume that nuisance parameters have limited complexity under Donsker properties . This study expands those boundaries by allowing η0\eta_0 η0 to be highly dimensional and estimated using machine learning techniques. Another issue it addresses is the bias inherent to ML methods, arising from overfitting and regularization in the estimation of nuisance parameters. Through the introduction of orthogonal Neyman moments and the application of cross-fitting , the paper effectively eliminates these biases. Furthermore, it highlights the lack of a unified framework in the literature to address complex models in multiple contexts. Addressing this gap, the paper proposes a generalized approach that can be applied to both partially linear regressions and treatment effects and instrumental variable models, thus offering a flexible and robust solution.
The main purpose of the study is to develop a methodological framework that allows valid and efficient inferences about parameters of interest in environments with high dimensionality and complexity of nuisance parameters. This is achieved by incorporating orthogonal moments, which reduce sensitivity to errors in parameter estimation , and the use of cross-fitting , which mitigates the effects of overfitting and improves the efficiency of estimators. Finally, the approach is validated theoretically and practically in various contexts relevant to modern econometrics and statistics, consolidating itself as a significant contribution in these fields.
Valuable and specific next steps to improve the proposed methodological framework are as follows:
A key strategy is to develop computationally more efficient versions of cross-fitting to reduce the computational burden. To this end, it is proposed to explore approaches such as adaptive subsampling or parallelization , especially in the case of large data sets. This would make the methodological framework more scalable and practical, adapting to large and high -dimensional datasets , which would broaden its applicability in real and complex contexts.
Furthermore, work should be done on extending the robustness in the selection of machine learning methods. One proposal is to design automatic criteria for the selection and tuning of hyperparameters of ML models used to estimate nuisance parameters. This could be achieved through cross-validation or Bayesian techniques. The goal is to reduce the sensitivity of the framework to arbitrary decisions during implementation and thereby improve its applicability in different empirical contexts.
Another important step is to relax the convergence rates required in the methodological framework. To do so, it is suggested to incorporate additional regularization or robust methods that manage errors in the estimation of nuisance parameters. This would allow handling scenarios where ML estimators do not meet ideal convergence rates, making the framework more flexible and applicable to noisy data or in situations where the ML model fit is not perfect.
Finally, a broader empirical validation is proposed by applying the methodological framework in empirical studies in various domains, such as economics, health or public policies. This validation would allow the practical performance of the method to be evaluated and the methodology to be adjusted according to the observed needs, which would help to generalize its applicability and demonstrate its effectiveness in real problems of causal inference.
In summary, the paper presents a significant contribution in addressing the classical challenge of inference on low-dimensional parameters when the nuisance parameters are highly complex and of high dimensionality . Through the Double / Debiased Machine Learning (DML) framework, it combines modern machine learning tools with robust statistical principles, ensuring consistent and efficient estimates in complex settings. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional semiparametric models , enabling the estimation of high-dimensional nuisance parameters and addressing bias issues arising from overfitting and regularization in ML methods.

The paper also points out important gaps in the literature, such as the lack of a generalized framework for complex models and the inability of existing approaches to adequately handle biases in nuisance parameter estimation. Through the introduction of orthogonal moments and the use of cross-fitting , the study closes these gaps, offering a more robust and flexible solution.

Despite its strengths, the approach presents challenges in terms of computational complexity, reliance on assumptions about the convergence of ML models, and the need to tune hyperparameters appropriately. These aspects may limit the practical applicability of the method in some contexts. Therefore, next steps include developing more efficient versions of cross-fitting , creating automatic criteria for ML method selection, relaxing the required convergence rates, and empirical validation in a variety of domains to assess the performance of the methodological framework and ensure its applicability to real-world causal inference problems.
