What is the research question of the article?

The article focus on how to estimate low-dimensional parameters in the presence of high-dimensional parameters or non-parametric nuisance functions. It also covers the use of sample splitting.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

The paper shows that using double ML estimator, which includes orthogonalization, we can overcome regularization biases. Besides, through sample-splitting procedure, the roles of main and auxiliary samples is not a problem, as by averaging these two estimators, we regain efficiency instead if we just use the main sample. In that line, the study remarks that it is necessary to split the sample in order to get unbiased estimators. To sum up, the property of Neyman orthogonality and the sample splitting allow to have a good estimator.

What is the contribution of the paper?

The main contribution of this study is that it offers a procedure for estimating and make inference on the main regression coefficient in highly complex settings. That is, when there is a high-dimensional nuisance parameter.

What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

Next steps include continue using DML to estimate the main parameter in empirical cases, as the classical semi-parametric estimation framework is problematic when there is a nuisance parameter.
