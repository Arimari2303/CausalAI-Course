## What is the research question of the article? 

In my view, the research question is try to have another view of machine learning. Specially, when exist a covariate that is correlated with the control variable (orthogonalization). For the reason, when exist this data, the machine learning method change to similar Neyman orthogonalization. 

In this view, the method of lasso or post-lasso change and it will be combinated with the terms that we learn on the course beggining like the Frisch-Waugh Theorem, the crossfitting, bootstrapping, random forest and others. So, we need to choose one of them to resolve this type of "problems", but it will also depend of the data. 


## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strength to answering the research question is present all the machine learning methods that we learned in the course and also appear in this article. On other hand, it show the mathematical language of every method, when exist a orthogonalization problem. 
In my point of view, the weaknesses appears when the authors don't explain the possible machine language to use when exist this type of "problems".
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
The contributions of the document is helpfull. For the reason that the research can clean the data with every machine learning method. And do they estimations more robust. 


## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
The next step to move forward is translate this paper to machine languages.
