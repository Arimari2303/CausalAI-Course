1 What is the research question of the article?
The research question of the paper is to critically reevaluate Mincer's standard earnings equation 30 years after the publication of Schooling, Experience and Earnings. In that sense, the question it hopes to answer is: Â¿How does the Mincer equation stand in the light of all these advances in empirical labor economics?

2 What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
Lemieux (2016) reviews recent research on the validity of Mincer's original specifications, where we can identify where one of the strengths of the model proposed by Mincer continues to be useful in the stable environment where there is an increase in academic performance successively in time as well as in the time that Mincer's form was proposed. But in many cases, it may overstate or understate the effect of experience and schooling on earnings for some groups. In particular, it tends to understate the effect of experience on the earnings of young workers. In a less stable environment, however, major shifts in the relative supply of different age-education groups can induce important changes in the structure of wages that have to be taken into account when estimating a standard Mincer equation. This can either be achieved by adding cohort effects to a standard Mincer equation, or by explicitly modeling the relative supply and demand for different groups of workers.

3 How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution?
The paper's contribution is made through different sections where aspects such as whether the natural logarithm is the appropriate transformation for earnings, whether education should be linearized, among other issues. In this sense the paper contributes with a "fine-tune" of the simple Mincer human capital earnings function as the text says. This is because the Mincer equation may underestimate or overstate the effect of experience and schooling on the earnings of some groups. Another point found, which contributes to the literature, is that Mincer's basic human capital earnings function does not seem to fit the data for the 1980s and 1990s compared to the 1960s and 1970s. The paper points out that 30 years later such an equation does not fit as well as before, as we are no longer in a stable environment, where educational attainment grows smoothly over successive cohorts of workers.

4 What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
As mentioned in the article, the next main step is to adjust the Mincer equation, considering a joint estimation of the specifications and recommendations presented in the article, that is, to estimate a "fine-tune" Mincer equation with current data, where at present, our working environment is experiencing a great technological advancement.
