1. Is the Mincer equation still a good benchmark model given the advances in empirical labor economics? 
2. To answer this question the author only focuses on the issue of the robustness of Mincer’s original specification. To do so, he reviews the results of few recent studies that have implications for the choice of an accurate ‘‘benchmark’’ earnings equation a la Mincer and supplements the main findings of these studies with some new empirical results based on the Current Population Survey (CPS) for the years 1979 to 2001. However, the author doesn´t attempt to cover the much larger literature on earnings determination that has been well surveyed elsewhere.
3. Lemieux's contribution was finding that  the Mincer equation remains an accurate benchmark for estimating wage determination equations provided that it is adjusted by including a quartic function in potential experience instead of just a quadratic, also by allowing for a quadratic term in years of schooling to capture the growing convexity in the relationship between schooling and wages, and finally by allowing for cohort effects to capture the dramatic growth in returns to schooling among cohorts born after 1950. 
4. A next step suggested by the author to further this analysis would be to see whether the fit of the Mincer equation improves in the next decade or so, now that the wage structure appears to be stabilizing again.
