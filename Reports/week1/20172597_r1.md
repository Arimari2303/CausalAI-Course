1. What is the research question of the article? (verde)

    The research question of the Lemieux's article is 'How does the Mincer equation considering advances in the empirical labor economics, such as a expansion in the computer power or sophisticated parametric and non-parametric procedures. Furthermore, in what context is the Mincer equation still a benchmark for estimating wages?   The goal is reevaluate the original specification of the Mincer equation thirty years after the publication of Schooling, Experience and Earnings.

2.   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question? 

I don't find any weakness of the approach to answer the question. In my opinion his methodology was his main strength. On the one hand, it performs an analysis with recent studies, which allows it to draw very interesting conclusions by comparing the past data used by Mincer with more current data that show significant differences. On the other hand, the way in which he addresses his answer is very assertive: from the initial variable (the income log), to the final variable (the quadratic function of the potential experience) he explains what other authors have mentioned and contributed regarding the subject.

3. How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution?

The main contribution of this article is that it presents and links to various investigations that have contributed to the evolution of the simple version of the Mincer equation. He thus concludes that this continues to be an important reference point for estimating wages with respect to education, considering a stable environment. However, changes in educational achievement require adjustment of the model.

4. What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question? 

A next step for the current decade would be to perform that same analysis considering the current data and changes in which we live in order to discover if there are even more changes. Likewise, as the author proposes, the literature on income determination could be covered.
