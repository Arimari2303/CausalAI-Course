The article titled: The ''Mincer Equation'' Thirty Years After Education, Experience, and Income poses the following questions: How does the Mincer equation stand up in light of these advances in empirical labor economics?

The strength of the article is that it shows me that after 30 years the Mincer equation is still applicable and that the equation that Mincer proposed consists of and how to represent earnings in a logarithmic expression and an adjustment is made to the variable of years of experience work adding a quartic polynomial function. It also discusses whether the natural logarithm is the appropriate transformation for earnings, discussing whether education should enter linearly and potential experience enter as a quadratic function in the equation, or whether it is convenient to separate years of schooling completed from years of education. . of work experience, and for all these topics it is analyzed with graphs, tables and other authors are mentioned to reinforce his ideas.

A weakness of the article is that it only shows an investigation for a sector of the population, in this case it refers only to white men in the US, and this may vary the results, they may vary if other factors such as race or gender are considered. where the convexity and concavity of the curves can behave differently.
The contribution of the article is that the behavior of wages is evaluated in relation to years of schooling and work experience for the eighties, revealing the possible structural changes that could occur in the future for our present century. 

In addition, another contribution is that it serves as a basis for future analytical research based on the Mincer equation and shows whether the relationships between income with years of education and work experience have varied over time.

We have related the salary behavior with the years of study and work experience and it has been compared for different periods of time. It would be innovative for a future study to relate the years of study with the income that will be generated in different labor sectors such as countries. maybe there could be a change in the results.
