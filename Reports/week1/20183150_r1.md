## What is the research question of the article ?

* The article proposes to begin a discussion about the realibity of the Mincer's ecuation taking into account of many especific points and try to respond: "How does the Mincer equation stand in light of all these advances in empirical labor economics? Is it time to revise our benchmark model? "

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

* The strengths of the article are creative and concise. First, the article mentioned how this model or ecuation arose, what were its objectives, then, explain some adaptations of it like use a log expression to represent the earnings and add a quadratic function of year of experience working. After that, the article criticizes of a very dynamic way the characteristics of the Mincer's ecuation as if it is correct to put earnings in log, if the education and the wage of people have a lineal relation, if it's precise to model the experience working in a cuadratic form, or more direct like if it's convenient to separate the years of completed schooling from the years of working experience , and for all those topics the article used graphics, tables and mentioned another authors to reforce its ideas. On the other hand, the article doesn't show as many data of years after 2000 as years before it, so it would have been complementay to add more years for people interested in these topics. Another weak point of the article it's that dind't show investigations by regions, as the results can vary. 

## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

* The contribution of the document is that put many options to future investigators in adapt their researchers based in Mincer's ecuation and show how, along the time, the relation between years of education and experience working has varied. Another contribution is that emphasizes that the Mincer equation evaluates more clearly the behavior of the salary related to the years of schooling and work experience when the data is around the eighties leaving in evidence the posible structural changes in twenty first century caused by the information technologies. 

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

* Today, the behavior of wage relationated with years of study and experience working are different at thirty years ago and it would be innovative to reconceptualize some variables, that is, relate the years of study with the profits that will be generated in the sector for which it is being studied or discriminate between the years of experience in just one sector from the years of experience in many sectors.
