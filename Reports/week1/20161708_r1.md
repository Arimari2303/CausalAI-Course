# Report N°1: The "Mincer equation" Thirty years after *schooling, experience, and earnings* 
## 1. Research question

According to the paper, the research question would be the following: How is the empirical perfomance of the standard Mincer earnings equation thirty years after the publication of Schooling, Experience and Earnings? The paper focuses on the robustness of the original Mincer specification. For this, the author splits his study in six subtopics: earnings in logs, linear education, quadratic experience, additive separability in education and experience, and including cohort effects. 

## 2. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper to answering the research question

Regarding the strengths, the author has the support of previous studies that show errors in the estimation of the data due to the specification of the standard Mincer equation. This study supports with evidence the need to include a quartic function in potential experience instead of a quadratic function. Besides, it shows evidence that the Mincer equation doesn't fit recent data, since it only applies to stable environment where educational achievement grows smoothy across cohorts.

Regarding the weaknesses of the paper, the study doesn´t recognize that there are other variables that can also influence the estimation of the hourly wage. Therefore, it affects the specification of the standard Mincer. On the other hand, the author implicitly mentions that the effect of skills can be similar to that of experience or schooling and doesn't refer to hidden skills.

## 3. Contribution of the paper to solve the research question

The main contribution of this study is to work with updated data from the 1979 and 1991 outgoing rotation group (ORG) suplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS). In addition, unlike other studies that use weekly earnings, this one use hourly wage as depedent  variable in the regression analysis. This variable is report directly in the ORG. The author mentions it reduces measurement problems linked with defining hourly wages as earnings divided by hours.

## 4. Next steps to move this question forward

As we can see, the samples of this study only report information on the hourly wage of men. It mentions the relationship of experience profiles and wage gaps for college and high school graduates. A step forward would be to include a gender variable and review the gender wage gap and how it affects to the standar Mincer earnings equation.
