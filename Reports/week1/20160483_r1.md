What is the article's question?

In "The "Mincer Equation" Thirty years after shcooling, experience, and earnings" (2006), Leimeux evaluates the standard Mincer earnings equation's ability to fit new data 30 years after its publication. 

What are the strengths and weaknesess of the article to answer this question?

One of the most important strengths of the article resides in that it is able to evaluate the changes that ocurred in the labor market to explain why the original Mincer equation fails to estimate new data. This is the case, for example, of the original asumption that the return on experience is the same for diferent educational groups. Also, the article is able to propose modifications to the Mincer equation (explained below), that can capture the features of this set of information.

One weakness, however, is that it proposes some modifications that don't seem to be backed up by an economic interpretation, and apparently only in order to get a "better performance" of a Mincer equation under a new data set. This is the case, for example, of the quartic term in potential experience.

How does the article advance on the knowledge of the question? What is the contribution of the article?

The article's contribution resides in proposing, based on related studies and new empirical evidence presented in the document, a modified version of the Mincer equation that can accurately estimate wage determination using more recent data sets, and given changes in the labor market. 

Specifically, the author proposes three modifications. First, adding higher order polynomials (quartic) in potencial experience helps the Mincer equation to capture the empirical relationship between years of experience and earnings. In fact, according to the article, a "usual" Mincer equation would understate wage growth for younger workers, and estimate an abrupt decline in wages for older ones. Second, adding a quadratic term in years of schooling to capture the convexity of the relationship between schooling and wages helps the Mincer equation to adapt to a new unstable environment in the labor market (an abrupt growth in demand not matched by an increase in relative supply for skilled workers). Finally, the author proposes to include cohorts effects to capture divergencies in returns to schooling from people born after 1950, due to a lower supply of highly educated workers in that period.

What would be the next steps to advance in this question?

In the near future, it would be a good idea to systematize the different possible specifications of the Mincer equations, given that every specification is conditional to a context. Now we know that what worked for Mincer in those years need not be the same equation that we ought to use, given our context.
