# Report 8: Estimating treatment effects with causal forest: an application (Athey, Wager)

## What is the research question of the article?

This paper tries to find an estimator to the treatment effect in cases where exists heterogeneity in the dataset by using causal forest. It is important to remark that the dataset provided was already randomized, this let us to suppose unconfoundedness in covariates, but it is needed to cluster by regions (or schools).

Since there exists 76 schools, the main of the paper is to estimate a treatment effect for each subgroup.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?

The main strength of this paper is the explaination of causal forest, using Maths and an R code. Also, it is important to remark the usage of a randomized sample but the potential heterogeneity caused by regions or common locations for some observations.

The main weakness is that the obtained estimators suffer from confoundedness, and report no significance using causal forest.

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, it does. It is a good start for learn about causal forest, even though the empirical example doesn't bring us a good estimation.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

The next steps would be more empirical researchs using causal forest. It is still a new method that needs more training to fit as useful causal model for special cases.
