##  Research question

The study revolves around how to estimate treatment effects of a nudge-like intervention designed to motivate students with a growth mindset. To do this, it applies causal forests. However, the dataset have two methodological challenges. First, it seems there are selection effects although the study was randomized. Second, the students are not independently sample. So, the results could be affected by student culture or the way the intervention was implemented for example.

## Strengths and weaknesses of the paper to answering the research question

Using causal forests, it is possible to deal with unknown treatment propensities and clustering of outcomes. Besides, causal forests address the problem of selection bias.

On the other hand, about the effectiveness in estimating treatment heterogeneity by causal forest, the test of heterogeneity tell us that, although the point estimates are consisten with the presence of heterogeneity, none of them is significant. However, if we consider specific variables such as "pre-existing mindset", we find heterogeneity along this variable, which is important because it is one of the pre-specified hypotheses. Indeed, in the causal forest, "pre-exisitng mindset" is the most important variable.

## Contribution of the paper to solve the research question

The paper uses robust clustering and orthogonalization methods for robustness against confounding in forest causal analysis. This is a difference compared to a direct analysis based on machine learning, since these methods are not included in this case.

## Next steps to move this question forward

It is neccesary to discuss how to work with clustered observations when heterogeneity is included in the model. To move the research question forward, it is recommended to study the many approaches such as, for instance, the traditional approach, which works with "fixed effects" or an approach with a functional random effects model.
