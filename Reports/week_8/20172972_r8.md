## What is the research question of the article? 

In my view, the research question is answer the three principal questions: 
1. Was the mindset intervention effective in improving student achievement?
2. Was the effect of the intervention moderated by school level achievement (X2) or pre-existing mindset norms (X1)? In particular there are two competing hypotheses about how X2 moderates the effect of the intervention: Either it is largest in middle-achieving schools (a “Goldilocks effect”) or is decreasing in school-level achievement. 
3. Do other covariates moderate treatment effects

And estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect (Y_i and W_i) through clustering 72 schools (cluster-robust random forest). 

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strength to answering the research question is present three different treatment effects to estimate the Y_i and W_i. The first treatment is the random forest, using the testing data and the training data through a linear model (thau or r-learner or CATE) and estimate the root-mean-squared error. 
The second treatment try to estimate the out-of-bag data or the out-of-fold data through a linear function. This method create two synthetic predictors: C_i and D_i that are correlated with the out-of-bag treatment effect estimates,where D_i is a measure of the quality of the estimates of the heterogenity effects and C_i absorbs the average treatment effect. 
The third effect is the rest of D_i and C_i, because is the estimation of the out-of-bag covariates. 
\
In my point of view, the weaknesses appears when the authors don't explain what is the omnibus method. This term could be easy to know for a elemental economic or statistic.
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
The contributions of the document is the large ways to estimate the heterogeneus treatment effect in R. Also, this article will help to the reserachers, for the clustering, orthogonalization, test_calibration function wich will be helpfull in the post-evaluation. 


## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
The next step to move forward is translate this paper to another languages.
