# I. Research proposal
It seeks to estimate the treatment effects of applying casual forests in order to assess the impact of a growth mindset intervention on student achievement. It also seeks to find out whether the effect of the intervention was moderated by school performance or by pre-existing mindset norms.
# II. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering the question
The causal forest method used allows for the study of treatment heterogeneity in the data and an algorithmic specification that can design an observational study with unknown treatment propensities and cluster the results at the school level. They also used a robust clustering and orthogonalisation method.
# III. Contribution of the paper/ Motivation for publication
The authors are motivated to help elucidate the drivers of successful approaches to treatment effect estimation.The topic is important for the scientific and policy community as it can monitor whether an incentive makes any difference to academic performance.
# IV. Next steps to advance the question
As mentioned by the author, it would be interesting to outline the benefits and disadvantages of different approaches to heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in pooled data.
