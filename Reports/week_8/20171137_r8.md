### Lecture: Estimating Treatment Effects with Causal Forests: An Application	
### Author: Victoria Olivera (20171137)

* What is the research question of the article?

In this article, the research question is how to apply causal forests to a dataset derived from the National Study of Learning Mindsets. Given this data, there is a particular interest in the three following questions:
1.	Was the mindset intervention effective in improving student achievement?
2.	Was the effect of the intervention moderated by school-level achievement (X2) or pre-existing mindset norms (X1)? In particular, there are two competing hypotheses about how X2 moderates the intervention’s effect: It is largest in middle-achieving schools (a “Goldilocks effect”) or is decreasing in school-level achievement.
3.	Do other covariates moderate treatment effects?

* What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper’s approach to answering that question?

Regarding the strengths, on one hand, the authors were capable to answer the two methodological challenges that the dataset exhibited. First, although the National Study itself was a randomized study, there seem to be some selection effects in the synthetic data used. For this reason, the study was taken as an observational rather than randomized. Second, the students in this study are not independently sampled, and there appears to be considerable heterogeneity across schools. Such a situation could arise if there are unobserved school-level features that are important treatment effect modifiers. The authors assumed that the outcomes of students within the same school may be arbitrarily correlated within a cluster, and then apply cluster-robust analysis tools. These two challenges in this setting involved an observational study design with unknown treatment propensities and clustering of outcomes at the school level. Causal forests
allow for an algorithmic specification that addresses both challenges. On other hand, the causal forest analysis as opposed to the more direct machine learning-based analysis allows the use of cluster-robust methods and the orthogonalization for robustness to confounding. 

Regarding the weakness, when the researchers account for the clustering, they find hints of the presence of treatment heterogeneity (especially along the variable X1), but accurate non-parametric of $\tau(x)$ is difficult. 

* How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)

The main article’s contribution is the proposal of a framework to work with clustered observations when modeling treatment heterogeneity. Likewise, the causal forest analysis allows the use of cluster-robust methods and the orthogonalization for robustness to confounding. 

* What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

The next steps to move forward are the following ones. First, the authors to identify causal effects, assume unconfoundedness. To relax this assumption, one could try to find an instrument for treatment assignment or conduct a sensitivity analysis for hidden confounding. Second, there is a need for a deeper discussion of how to work with clustered observations when modeling treatment heterogeneity. t would be of considerable interest to develop a better understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches to heterogeneous treatment effect estimation on clustered data.
