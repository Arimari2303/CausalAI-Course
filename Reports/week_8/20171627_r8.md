- ## What is the research question of the article?

    The article discusses how causal forests use estimated propensity scores to be more robust to confounding and how the handle data with clustered errors. And they answer the research question by analyzing the dataset derived from National Study of Learning Mindsets. 

- ## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

    One strength of the paper is that the authors do not only want to explain what the effects in the sample are but they want to be able to generalize their results. Also I find important that the article includes the code that they use, which is important to replicate the results and do further investigation. 
    
    The main limitation is that there was not found strong evidence of treatment heterogeneity.


- ## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution?

    The contribution of the article relies on the causal forest analysis that uses cluster robust methods and orthogonalization for robustness to confounding. Which differs from a more direct machine learning analysis. 

- ## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

    As the authors mention there is a traditional approach to capture cluster effects, via “fixed effects” or “random effect”. They propose another approach that can be interpreted as fitting a functional random effects model this allows for each cluster to have its own main and treatment effect function. Therefore, a valuable contribution would be to implement the method proposed by the authors on future investigations and compare the pros and cons of the different approaches to heterogeneous treatment effect estimation on clustered data .
