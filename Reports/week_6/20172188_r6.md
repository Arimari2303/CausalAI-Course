# I. Research proposal

The authors seek to answer why standard errors should be adjusted for clustering in some cases but not in others, how the practice of clustering can be justified in observational studies but not in randomised experiments, why conventional clustering is a potentially conservative all-or-nothing adjustment and whether there are alternative methods that are responsive to the data and less conservative, and in what contexts the choice of whether and how to cluster makes a difference. They propose that clustering may be necessary to address sampling problems if sampling follows a two-stage process: a subset of clusters is sampled from a population of clusters and units are sampled from the sampled clusters.

# II. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering the question

One of the strengths of the paper is that they show the importance of their research by explaining three misconceptions in clustering settings. The first is that the need for clustering depends on the presence of a non-zero correlation between the residuals of units belonging to the same cluster. The second is that it is asymptotically not wrong to use clustering adjustments when they are not necessary, but it is possible to cluster standard errors. Finally, that there are two options, either to completely adjust the clustering with standard errors or not to adjust the standard errors at all and use robust standard errors. This allows the reader to take an interest in the research and helps them to correct for these errors through research advice. 
A weakness might be the fact that it can explain the reasons why each option or method is used in more detail, which for some non-statisticians would be difficult to understand.


# III. Contribution of the paper/ Reason for publication
The study allows the standard errors to account for the existence of clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. It proposes new variance estimators to deal with situations where conventional cluster standard errors are unnecessarily conservative and robust standard errors are too small. In addition, it proposes a novel framework for clustering based on Abdadie et al. (2020) for the analysis of regression estimators from a design perspective.

# IV. Next steps to advance the question

It would be interesting if the authors show the codes they used to estimate the results as it would allow students or those interested in the topic with not much programming knowledge to understand what happens in each procedure.
