### When Should You Adjust Standard Errors for Clustering?

##### 1. What is the research question of the article?
In this article discuss on the important decision of when should you cluster standard errors. The authors argue that there are two reasons for clustering standard errors: a sampling design reason, which arises because you have sampled data from a population using clustered sampling, and want to say something about the broader population; and an experimental design reason, where the assignment mechanism for some causal treatment of interest is clustered.

##### 2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
The strengths lie in the fact that it is a document that tells you in which case to cluster, even though there is much debate about when you can rely on asymptotic inference, bootstrapping, and randomization approaches. 

##### 3. How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)
The contributions of the article are that they explain the clustering of standard errors. First, the sampling design reason for clustering arises because you have sampled data from a population using clustered sampling and you want to say something about the broader population. Where whether or not clustering makes a difference to standard errors should not be the basis for deciding whether or not to cluster. They point out that there is a misconception that if clustering matters, clustering should be done.
Second, the experimental design reason for clustering, where the assignment mechanism for some causal treatment of interest is clustered. This happened when groups of units, rather than individual units, are assigned to a treatment. 

##### 4. What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?
I consider that the next steps, for corrected standard errors with clustered data, is to perform more studies with multiple simulations considering small numbers of clusters and with little variation within clusters in the explanatory variables, since working with this type of information seriously underestimates the standard errors of the coefficients and their associated confidence intervals, so an alternative method should be developed to produce more precise estimates of the standard error and confidence interval.
