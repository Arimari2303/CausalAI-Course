## What is the research question of the article? 

In my view, the research question is try to know what type of variance estimators are better for clustering units. The authors mentioned five variance estimators: the typical variance estimator, variance estimator robust, variance estimator cluster, causal cluster variance (CCV), Two-Stage-Cluster-Bootstrap (TSCB). The two last variance estimator are the newest that the authors added to resolve some problems which the first had.  

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strength to answering the research question is present different cases of clustering units (data) and mentioned why is important to know what type of variance estimator used in those cases. Also, the authors mentioned the weaknesses of every variance estimator or standard errors and try to figure out with mathematical theory in which situation are better to use the different standard errors. Finally, another strength is the last empirical example, where the authors try to show us the hardest case of clustering unit and the type of standard error is better in that case.\
\
In my point of view, the weaknesses appears when the authors presents the diferent cases. Because, if you know statistic maybe it could be easy to imagine some of the cases that tha authors mentioned. However, the reader not just need to know the basic statistic theory, i'm very sure that the article is for readers who knows intermedium statistic theory. 
Maybe it would be better to mentioned examples of real life, or some problems of researchers usually had. 
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
This article was written more than 4 years ago, so the advance knowledge is for the researchers who use clusteing data. They now know more than one standard error and why this is so important to this type of data. 
\
## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
The next step to move forward is show another standard errors or estimators variance for another type of data or units, but it will be better for clustering units because for inference causal knowledge is usefull. This newest estimators variance could resolve another diferent case, maybe some recently case and problem for researchers who use clustering units.
