### Lecture: When Should You Adjust Standard Errors for Clustering?
### Author: Victoria Olivera (20171137)

* What is the research question?

In this article, the research question is when you should adjust standard errors for clustering. This question arises due to the following situations among other things. First, we do not always need clustering hinges on the presence of a non-zero correlation between residuals for units belonging to the same cluster. Second, what happens in intermediate cases where conventional cluster standard errors are unnecessarily conservative and robust standard errors are too small. Then the authors show that a perspective based on estimation of causal effects leads to a different, and in our view more compelling and more empirically relevant, argument for adjusting standard errors for cluster effects.

* What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paperâ€™s approach to responding to that question?

Regarding the strength, the proposed framework allows researchers to account for settings where there is variation in the fraction of treated units across clusters, but not all the units in the same cluster have the same treatment value. That case, which is of substantial relevance for empirical work, has not been previously covered in the econometrics literature. 
Regarding the weaknesses, the introduction of the cluster design component of the variance raises a number of issues that the authors do not address in their article. For example, the dependence structure in the assignment process may have multiple layers, requiring multi-level clustering adjustments. Also, the results suggest that estimators other than the least squares and fixed effect estimators, for example, inverse-variance weighted combinations of the between and appropriately weighted within estimators may have better properties.

* How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)

In this paper, three contributions are found. The first is a novel framework for clustering. In this framework, they allow for both clustering in the sampling process as well as clustering in the assignment process. The framework also clarifies what we can learn from the data about the need to adjust standard errors for clustering. Specifically, they find that the data are not informative about the need to adjust for clustering in the sampling, but they are informative about the need to adjust for clustering in the assignment process. In the second contribution, they derive the large sample variances, that take into account variation both from sampling and assignment, for the least squares and the fixed effect estimators. After that, we can see that the robust standard errors are generally too small, and the cluster standard errors are unnecessarily conservative. The third contribution is that they propose new variance estimators (CCV-TSCB) to deal with intermediate settings where conventional cluster standard errors are unnecessarily conservative and robust standard errors are too small.

* What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

The next step to move forward on the question is to address the issues that arise when they introduce the cluster design component of the variance.  For example, the researchers can develop a framework of multi-level clustering adjustments.
