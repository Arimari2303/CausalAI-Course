- ## What is the research question of the article?

    When and how should we adjust standard error for clustering?

- ## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

    One strength is that the authors show the empirical relevance of their results by analyzing a sample from the U.S decennial census. And they prove that in all designs the CVV and specially the TSCB standard errors still outperform the robust and cluster standard errors. 

    One of the weaknesses of the paper’s approach is that it has a lot of equations which can be overwhelming if the reader doesn’t have previous knowledge about clustering econometrics. 

- ## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution?

    The contribution of the article relies on the development of a framework for clustering, which allows for both clustering in the sampling process as well as clustering in the assignment process. 
    
    Also, when comparing the variances derived from both sampling and assignment for the least squares and the fixed effect estimators with the robust and cluster variances the results show that the robust standard errors are generally too small, and the cluster standard errors unnecessarily conservative.

    The new framework allows researchers to account for settings where there is variation in the fraction of treated units across clusters, but not all the units in the same cluster have same treatment value.

    And the third contribution is that the authors propose a new variance estimator, the Causal Cluster Variance (CCV), that is valid for all three cases. 

- ## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

    As the author mentions there are several issues that arise when the cluster design component of the variance is introduced. One of them is that the dependence structure in the assignment process may have multiple layers, which would require multi-level clustering adjustments. So the future work should take this into consideration.

    Another step that should be taken would be to analyze if there are estimators that could have better properties than the least squares and fixed effect estimators.
