# When Should You Adjust Standard Errors for Clustering?

## Research question
The main questions of the paper are the followings: Why is it neccesary to adjust standard errors for clustering in some cases but not others? Are there alternative methods that respond to data and are less conservative?

## Strengths and weaknesses of the paper to answering the research question
About the strengths of the proposed new framework, we can learn from the data to decide if we should adjust standard error for clustering. This framework helps to divide the role of clustering in sampling process and assigment process. For example, in sampling  process, the data are not informative about it. In contrast, in assigment process, the data are informative to take the decision. On the other hand, the study shows evidence that the conventional variance estimator might under-estimate and it offers new two variance estimators (CCV and TSCB), which have smaller standard errors compared to cluster standard errors, but larger than robust standard errors.

About the weaknesses, the authors admit that there are other estimators that have better properties in comparison with least squares and fixed estimators. For example, inverse-variance weighted combinations. Furthermore, the assigment process is complex. It can be required multi-level clustering adjustments in some cases. This issue is not address in the papper.

## Contribution of the paper to solve the research question
The new framework based on the framework developed by Abadie et al. (2020) deal with the problem to choose between conventional cluster standard errors (conservative) and robust standard errors. The conventional framework says that if the cluster standard error are larger than robust standar errors, we should use the cluster standard errors. Apart from that, the study proposes two new variance estimators. The first one is Causal Cluster Variance (CCV), which is calculate with an analytic approach and the second one is Two-Stage-Cluster-Bootstrap (TSCB) 

## Next steps to move this question forward
As mentioned earlier, there are extensions that have better properties for the estimators and it is necessary to explore them.
