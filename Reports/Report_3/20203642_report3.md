In the paper written by Wager and Athey, the use of artificial intelligence in the context of causal inference is explored. With the aim of delving deeper into this literature, the paper seeks to answer the question of how to estimate and conduct causal inference on heterogeneous treatment effects using random forests to handle non-parametric and high-dimensional estimation.

This paper has numerous strengths. First, it transforms the traditional random forest into a causal forest designed to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects and reach the conclusion of causal inference of these treatments .This is a major contribution of the study because random forests are used primarily for prediction. Also, this method allows modeling the  complex interactions .In the simulations, it shows improvement in terms of bias and variance over other methods such as nearest-neighbor matching,especially when the number of covariates increases. Additionally, it proves that it is possible to construct  and offers methods to build  confidence intervals to check the robustness of the result. 
One of the weaknesses of the paper is that the selection between double-sample forests or propensity forests  in order to get the optimal random forest model was done manually depending on the situation. This clearly limits the automation of the process. Another problem is that  controlling the bias in causal forests continues to be a challenge  and using more powerful splitting rules could help reduce this bias by focusing on the most relevant variables.
The contribution of this paper is the  presentation of  the causal forest as a method for causal estimation that captures heterogeneous treatment effects. Additionally, the study provides ways to verify the robustness of the results. In this context,the next step is  to apply these methodologies in research using real databases.This will demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods and allow for the evaluation of their results in practical settings.
