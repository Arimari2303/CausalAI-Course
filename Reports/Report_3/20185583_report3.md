# What is the paper's research question?

The article addresses the question of how to estimate and make inferences about heterogeneous effects using the random forest method.

# What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

Regarding strengths, they first present a novel method, a non-parametric causal forest model, to estimate heterogeneous effects of a program that is asymptotically valid and works in a large dataset. Second, the method is practical for constructing confidence intervals that have good coverage in simulations. Third, the theory for the asymptotic analysis of random forest algorithms is developed.

Regarding the limitations, the article manually chooses whether to use double-sample forests or propensity forests, the choice depends on which procedure seemed most appropriate in each problem scenario. The challenge needed are splitting rules that can help the choice automatically and soundly.

# How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? 

The article contributes to the literature on causal inference and Random Forest methods. First, the introduction of a new method to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using Causal Forest. This method, called "causal forest", presents absence of confounding, is consistent for the real treatment effects, has a centered and asymptotically Gaussian sampling distribution. Second, a general asymptotic theory is developed to be applied in a wide class of random forest algorithms. It is the first theory that allows any type of random forest to be used, including classification and regression forests, for statistical inference. Third, simulation experiments show that causal forests are more powerful than classical methods based on nearest neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates. 

# What would be one or two valuable, specific next steps to advance this question?

I consider that the next step to develop the research question is the optimization in the construction of trees for the causal forest and the introduction of the rules for choosing double-sample forests or propensity forests. The paper presents the partial characterization of how to build the trees for the causal forest, but more research is needed to develop methods that work well in a variety of environments and include the lesson rules. A relevant step would be to investigate different splitting strategies for the trees, such as minimizing the heterogeneity of the treatment effect within the leaves or maximizing the correlation between the treatment and the outcome within the leaves.
