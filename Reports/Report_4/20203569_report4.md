## Report 4: Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis 


### Student: Charles SÃ¡nchez Salas 

The paper aims to find how the combination of machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis of costumer reviews improves the accuracy of Airbnb rental price predictions. This study is important as it provides a tool that both property owners and customers can use to estimate competitive rental property prices using variables like property specifications, owner characteristics, and customer sentiment. 

In order to achieve this objective, the authors use different machine learning techniques , such as linear regression, support vector regression, K-means clustering with ridge regression and neural networks and compare their prediction performance. They find that SVR with an RBF kernel is the optimal model. The sentiment analysis of costumer's reviews using Textblob, allows the authors to include the customer perceptions to the model. On the other hand, the authors address the overfitting by applying variable selection thechniques, such as  the Lasso regularization model, which helps to reduce the model's complexity while minimizing variance and improving model's predictive performance. 

However, this study has some limitations. First of all, the use of a restrictive dataset limites the generalizability of the model's results to other contexts. Second, the more complex models, notably neural networks and gradient boosting had several overfitting problems and where affected by the uneven distribution of variables.In order to adress this problems, the expansion of dataset and the use of more sophisticated variables selection methods are suggest.  

This study provides new ways to improve the rental price prediction by incorporating subjective variables, such as the customer's perception of the property, using sentiment analysis techniques. The combining of the two worlds allows to have a more complex and complete model that includes both objective (property features) and subjective variables (customer's perception). The steps beyond this paper should be related to replicate this modelling using Airbnb listings from other cities and countries. On the other hand, the use of natural language processing models could enhance the sentiment analysis, due to this method can include more relevant information (not perceived by the human eye) about the customer perception to the model 

In summary, while there are some limitations related to model complexity and overfitting, this paper makes big steps predicting accuracy property prices by introducing subjective factors to the model using sentiment analysis.
