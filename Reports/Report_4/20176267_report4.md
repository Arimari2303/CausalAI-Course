The authors of the paper try to answer the question of how to develop a reliable model to predict Airbnb prices, which would be useful both for customers when calculating a fair price with the limited information they have, and for owners when setting prices that are convenient and fair for them. For this purpose, they considered features of the apartments (like location, property-specific characteristics) and also used sentiment analysis on user reviews, which is a new direction of analysis compared to other studies in the field. Their methods for prediction included L2-regularized linear regression, K-means clustering-based features coupled with Ridge regression, support vector regression (SVR) with an RBF kernel, neural networks to combine features, and regression trees with boosting.

One of the strengths of the paper is that the authors employ several machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and neural networks, which is very useful for comparing the effectiveness of each model in predicting Airbnb prices. This approach not only helps to identify the most effective model but also provides a broader view of how different techniques can capture the characteristics of the rental market and how they are useful in predicting prices.

The use of sentiment analysis based on customer reviews within the predictions is also one of the strengths of the paper and its main contribution. This is important, as it is understood that user experience can influence listings and demand. In other words, demand for a place-and thus prices-is directly impacted by a bad review, so user perception end up being the most important price-setting factor. In a key part of this study, the authors used the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of each review, giving it a score that represented the overall opinion of customers on a property. By doing this, the predictive model comes alive and further help property owners understand in numbers how guests influence their bottom line. (5 PTS)

On the other hand, the approach has some weaknesses, such as the risk of overfitting due to the large number of features in the dataset. This excess of variables may lead the model to capture noise rather than real patterns, affecting its ability to generalize to new cases. Although cross-validation and regularization techniques were used, the complexity of handling so many variables remains a challenge. 

Additionally, the study is limited to Airbnb listings in New York City, which restricts the applicability of the results to other markets. New York has very specific economic and social characteristics that are not replicated in other cities in the U.S. or in other countries. Rental market dynamics can vary significantly due to factors such as supply, demand, local regulations, and cultural preferences, making it difficult to extrapolate the findings of this study to other contexts. 

One of the main contributions of the article is the integration of sentiment analysis using TextBlob, which captures customer perceptions that influence pricing decisions in the collaborative economy. Additionally, the application of Lasso regularization to reduce the number of variables from 764 to 78 minimizes overfitting, improving both the model’s efficiency and computational performance. By comparing linear regression, SVR, and neural networks, the authors identify the most effective methods for predicting rental prices. The extensive dataset used strengthens the validity and generalizability of the results, ensuring their applicability to similar contexts. (4 PTS)

To further enhance the accuracy of the prediction models, it is recommended to expand the dataset to include multiple cities and regions. This would help identify price patterns across different markets, improving the model's ability to generalize. Furthermore, incorporating advanced natural language processing techniques, such as transformer-based models, could enrich sentiment analysis, thereby improving the overall predictive performance.
