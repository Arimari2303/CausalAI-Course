The authors of the paper try to answer the question of how to develop a reliable model to predict Airbnb prices, which would be useful both for customers when calculating a fair price with the limited information they have, and for owners when setting prices that are convenient and fair for them. For this purpose, they considered features of the apartments (like location, property-specific characteristics) and also used sentiment analysis on user reviews, which is a new direction of analysis compared to other studies in the field. Their methods for prediction included L2-regularized linear regression, K-means clustering-based features coupled with Ridge regression, support vector regression (SVR) with an RBF kernel, neural networks to combine features, and regression trees with boosting.
