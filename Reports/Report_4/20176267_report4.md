The authors of the paper try to answer the question of how to develop a reliable model to predict Airbnb prices, which would be useful both for customers when calculating a fair price with the limited information they have, and for owners when setting prices that are convenient and fair for them. For this purpose, they considered features of the apartments (like location, property-specific characteristics) and also used sentiment analysis on user reviews, which is a new direction of analysis compared to other studies in the field. Their methods for prediction included L2-regularized linear regression, K-means clustering-based features coupled with Ridge regression, support vector regression (SVR) with an RBF kernel, neural networks to combine features, and regression trees with boosting.

One of the strengths of the paper is that the authors employ several machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and neural networks, which is very useful for comparing the effectiveness of each model in predicting Airbnb prices. This approach not only helps to identify the most effective model but also provides a broader view of how different techniques can capture the characteristics of the rental market and how they are useful in predicting prices.

The use of sentiment analysis based on customer reviews within the predictions is also one of the strengths of the paper and its main contribution. This is important, as it is understood that user experience can influence listings and demand. In other words, demand for a place-and thus prices-is directly impacted by a bad review, so user perception end up being the most important price-setting factor. In a key part of this study, the authors used the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of each review, giving it a score that represented the overall opinion of customers on a property. By doing this, the predictive model comes alive and further help property owners understand in numbers how guests influence their bottom line.
