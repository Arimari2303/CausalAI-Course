## **"Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis"**

### The paper titled *“Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis”* addresses a research question how can machine learning techniques, combined with sentiment analysis of customer reviews, improve the accuracy of Airbnb listing price predictions? This question is relevant as property owners often struggle to set competitive yet profitable rental prices.
### The strengths of the paper’s approach is its comprehensive methodology, which integrates several machine learning techniques, including linear regression, support vector regression (SVR especially), and neural networks, to analyze a diverse set of features related to Airbnb listings. The authors employ sentiment analysis to quantify customer reviews, assigning sentiment scores that are then fed into the predictive model. This approach enables insight into customer perceptions as they may influence pricing, something that is often overlooked in traditional pricing models. Furthermore, the paper employs rigorous feature selection techniques such as Lasso regularization to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set from 764 to 78, thereby minimizing the risk of overfitting and improving model performance. The results indicate that the SVR model outperformed others, achieving an R² score of 69% and a smallest mean square error (MSE) of 0.147 on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. However, the paper also has its weaknesses. One notable limitation is the reliance on a single dataset, which may not fully capture the heterogeneity of Airbnb listings across different regions and markets. This could affect the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, while sentiment analysis adds value, the paper does not delve into the specific aspects of customer reviews that most significantly affect pricing and only gives values ​​of 1 and -1 which minimize dispersion, leaving a gap in understanding the qualitative factors at play.
### This paper brings knowledge to the field of rental price prediction by combining traditional machine learning techniques with sentiment analysis. The authors build on previous studies that focused primarily on quantitative features, such as property characteristics and location, by incorporating qualitative information from customer reviews. This dual approach not only improves the predictive accuracy of the model but also provides a broader view of the factors that influence Airbnb rental prices. This paper also shows an innovative methodology and will help both owners and customers by offering practical solutions for pricing strategies.
### Finally, to further advance the research question, a dataset from different geographic locations and not just NY would be useful. This would help validate the model’s efficacy and improve its applicability across diverse markets. Furthermore, exploring advanced neural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) could provide deeper insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of prices, potentially leading to even more accurate predictions.
