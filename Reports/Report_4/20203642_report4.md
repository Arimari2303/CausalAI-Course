Setting rental prices for properties is a challenge. In economic literature, many papers have evaluated property prices across different types and rental methods. This paper specifically evaluate the rental prices in Airbnb . The authorâ€™s research question is to identify the most effective model for predicting rental property prices on the platform. In order to approach the issue of limited data on property attributes ,it tested a huge a range of models such as spanning machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to develop a reliable price prediction tool that serves both property owners and potential customers.

This paper has many strengths. First, the models  have the ability to use a limited amount of data to build reliable predictive models for rental prices. Secondly, it introduces not only quantitative variables but also qualitative ones, such as user opinions, which are important when determining the price. Third,It evaluates many kinds of selection feature process in order to improve the prediction. Starting with 764 initial variables, the study uses three different selection methods : manual selection, Lasso regression, and P-value filtering. This experimentation allows to a better model for prediction. Also, the paper test a diverse set of machine learning models such as Ridge regression, neural networks  and support vector regression . This allows to compare model performance in order to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach in predicting rental prices. 
This article also has some major weaknesses. One of them is that despite the careful feature selection process, some models, particularly more complex ones such as neural networks and gradient boosting trees, present challenges in feature selection and can have overfitting problems. Additionally, this paper faces a significant geographic limitation because it focuses solely on New York rental data. This restricts the validation of the findings for other contexts because it could be different in other cities.

Finally,in order to advance the question of predicting rental prices, a valuable step would be to expand the data used because it would test the models in new scenarios. This paper only uses only data from Airbnb and focuses exclusively on New York. the analysis of data from other rental platforms and additional cities would provide a more complete view and help to validate the findings. Additionally, experimenting with alternative feature selection methods, such as Random Forest feature importance, could further refine the model by identifying the most influential variables more accurately.
