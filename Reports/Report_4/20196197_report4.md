*Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis*

The article by Rezazadeh, Nikolenko, and Rezaei (2019) focuses on the question _How can the rental price of a property on Airbnb be predicted using machine learning and sentiment analysis techniques?._ The question answers a practical need, that is to say a real, everyday problem that directly affects Airbnb users, both owners and customers; owners on platforms like Airbnb seek to set prices that maximize their profitability and attract customers, while customers try to find properties that justify the investment. The question involves exploring a relevant problem within the collaborative economy, where the price of a property is determined by several quantitative factors (such as location and physical characteristics) and qualitative factors (such as customer reviews); with adequate price prediction, the platform can better serve both parties, providing prices that reflect the real value of the property.

One of the strengths of the article's approach is the use of various prediction models (linear regression, neural networks, SVR (Support Vector Regression) and especially models based on decision trees. This variety of models not only analyses the research question but allows for an in-depth comparative analysis of which is the most appropriate technique and provides an analysis. This diversity improves the robustness of the study, by identifying the model that best fits the specific data. Another strength may be the use of the TextBlob library to analyse customer reviews and assign a sentiment score to each property (ranging from -1 to 1), thereby reflecting the customer's perception of the accommodation. This addition of a qualitative component is an innovative way of approaching real estate price prediction models. The collaborative economy was mentioned because user opinions are important in capturing the impact of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction on price.

We can also highlight the choice of advanced features. In the study, the initial data set included 764 features derived from different aspects of Airbnb properties, including variables about the property, the host, and customer reviews. With such a high number of variables, the model runs the risk of falling into two main problems: high variance and high computational complexity. In response to this, the article uses manual feature selection strategies and Lasso regularization, thus avoiding overfitting and reducing computational complexity. Lasso regularization helps reduce the number of features to consider only those that provide predictive value, thus optimizing the model since the initial set of features was very extensive and could cause high variance problems.

Among the weaknesses, we could mention the limitations of the implementation of neural networks. Considering that neural networks require a large amount of data and tuning parameters to offer a better result, the implementation in this work is relatively limited by the amount of data, which can hinder the level of sophistication that could have been obtained and thus reduce its advantage compared to the other proposed models. Another weakness is that the paper implements a clustering technique combined with Ridge regression, but faces problems due to the uneven frequency of prices in the dataset. This causes some clusters to receive very few training examples, which negatively impacts the performance of the model. This would call into question whether the clustering method could be a good choice in this context.

The main contribution of this paper is the addition of sentiment analysis as a predictor in the model, unlike other real estate price prediction models that have focused on quantitative and structured data, while this paper expands the scope to a combination of structured and unstructured data, which enriches the predictive model. Considering user reviews not only allows considering individual experiences, but also how these can influence demand and future rental prices. In addition, the use of Lasso in feature selection allowed to improve performance and reduce the variance of the model, identifying only the most relevant features for prediction; valuable especially in this dataset that contains many variables.

A next step could be to extend the dataset to different cities and regions to advance this research question. It would be beneficial to expand the analysis to other cities, allowing the evaluation of the models in varied contexts. This extension would help improve the generalization capacity of the model and could lead to the creation of specific submodels for different regions or cities. This would also allow to verify whether sentiment analysis has a similar impact in different areas or whether its effect varies depending on local culture or supply and demand dynamics.
