Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis (Rezazadeh Kalehbasti, Nikolenko, and Rezaei, 2019).

# What is the paper's research question?

The article seeks to answer the question of how property owners and customers can accurately evaluate rental values using machine learning techniques, neural networks, and natural language processing, with the aim of utilizing property characteristics.

# What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

The strengths of the article lie in the use of an SVR, neural networks, logistic regression, random forest regression, and gradient-driven decision trees. This variety of models allows for robust comparison and improves model selection. In addition, it includes sentiment analysis using TextBlob to extract customer opinions, a novelty that improves accuracy by capturing subjective aspects that influence the price. Likewise, feature reduction with Lasso aims to reduce data variability to optimize model performance. On the other hand, one of its weaknesses may be that it focuses solely on Airbnb in New York City, which limits generalization.

# How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? 

This article contributes to the literature by including sentiment analysis in rental price prediction, providing a more holistic model that takes both quantitative and qualitative factors into account. Moreover, it offers an exhaustive evaluation and comparison among models, and provides a reference for model choice within the Airbnb context.

# What would be one or two valuable, specific next steps to advance this question?

The next steps to consider include incorporating contextual and macroeconomic factors to expand the data to include seasonal demand trends, special events in the city, and economic factors that improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. Additionally, experiment with advanced neural network techniques by applying deep techniques without overfitting.
