This paper compares diffent machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing methods to develop a model for predicting Airbnb rental prices. The authors aim to create a model that can assist both property owners, by setting competitive prices, and customers, by evaluating listings accurately through a complete analysis set of features, such as rental attributes, owner characteristics, and customer reviews. In that sense, the study seeks to determine the most effective method for accurate price prediction in the Airbnb marketplace. Overall, the paper effectively compares the applicability of these methods in a high dimensionality setting and finds that the best performing model, in terms of highest R^2 and lowest MSE and MAE, is the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. 

One of the strengths of this paper is the use of diverese methodologies. The paper highlights the problematic of using the 756 available features, knowing that this can lead to a high variance error and problems with overfitting. Thus, the authors begin by trying different feature selection methods, which included manual selection, p-value analysis selection and the Lasso method. Once the features were selected, another set of methods were used to predict the Airbnb optimal rental prices. The methods used here are also diverse, and include models such as linear regression, tree-based models, support vector regression (SVR), K-means Clustering (KMC), and neural networks (NNs). The paper focuses mainly on the applicability of these models, which can give machine learning students a good idea on how these models can be used and why some can be more effective than others in different contexts.

Another strength of the paper is the use of sentiment analysis of customer reviews because it adds a new psychological dimension to the predictive model, improving its accuracy by capturing customer perceptions. I also believe that sentiment analysis can have a lot of success in a peruvian setting and for a different type of analysis. For example, in macroeconometric modelling, expectations play a big role in Peru, so capturing these via a sentiment analysis of newspaper titles or tweets by influential people can allow for better performing macroeconomic models.   

One weakness of the paper is not changing the feature selection methods for each model. For example, in the case of the Gradient Boost model, the performance was worse to other models due to a – still – large number of features being used. As highlighted by the text, a tree-based model is prone to high variance, so a high number of features can be associated with its worse performance.  Similarly, the neural network's performance was limited by the dataset size and feature distribution, indicating that larger or more balanced datasets could be beneficial. The K-means Clustering model also experienced difficulties due to the imbalanced feature distributions, leading to worse performance in clusters that had fewer training examples. These few weaknesses highlight some areas where the methodology could be improved to achieve better results and also make the comparison between models fairer. 

This paper makes a substantial contribution, on the applied side, to the field of rental price prediction by introducing a multifaceted approach that combines machine learning, deep learning, and sentiment analysis. Specifically, in the Airbnb context, finding that a Support Vector Regression (SVR) with an RBF kernel outperforms other models highlights the importance of modeling non-linear relationships in heterogeneous datasets. Aditionally, the use of sentiment analysis into the feature set is particularly innovative, as it takes into account both qualitative customer feedback and quantitative price prediction, which leads to a more complete understanding of the factors influencing rental prices. 

One possible next step to advance the research on Airbnb price prediction would be to explore other feature selection techniques, such as using Random Forest feature importance, which could potentially identify more predictive features and improve model performance beyond what Lasso regularization offers. Additionally, optimizing the neural network architecture by experimenting with deeper layers, incorporating regularization techniques like dropout, and adding data augmentation strategies could also address the current limitations related to dataset size and feature distribution. Another aspect to further can be expanding the dataset by incorporating additional training examples from other hospitality platforms.
