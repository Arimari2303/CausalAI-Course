The main research question is to identify the most suitable model for predicting Airbnb prices by evaluating machine learning techniques and using sentiment analysis to capture customer perceptions.

The innovation lies in providing predictions using advanced machine learning models. In addition to other advanced models, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), logistic regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression trees. The paper’s main strength is in its methodology. However, a weakness of the paper may be that it does not fully address the limitations of the models. In other words, there is no evolution or generalization of these models for broader cases beyond their usual applications.

Perhaps the study's most notable achievement is showcasing how advanced machine learning methods are used, as accurate predictions are crucial in everyday life such as predicting Airbnb prices. The method combines average sentiment scores and Lasso regression to capture customer perceptions and preferences.

Future steps following this paper could involve using new techniques, evaluating customer perceptions more deeply, or integrating theoretical models to introduce new variables that improve prediction accuracy. For instance, behavioral economics models could be used to introduce new variables
