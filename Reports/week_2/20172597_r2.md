    This paper centers on evaluating and discussing whether the Lasso penalty method is suitable for estimating High-Dimensional Sparce models. The authors focus on evaluating the penalty method in instrumental and partially linear variable models, as they are used to estimate structural economic effects. Therefore, the research question of the article would be: would the penalty methods (lasso) be useful to estimate the proposed models?

    One strength of the article is that it is based on a strong theoretical basis that the author presents citing various investigations that have been carried out on the subject. In addition, the text is enriched when that theory is put into practice through the analysis of the results of practical cases.

    The contribution of this article lies in the fact that more and more empirical researchers are working with high-dimensional data and trying to estimate models that have more regressors than observations (p>n). With the help of this article, it is verified that the penalty method is useful to identify a correct set of regressors and make the best possible estimate.

    Lastly, as mentioned in the article, the penalty method is only one among different methods for making estimates with high-dimensional data. One way to continue with this line of research would be to carry out an exhaustive analysis of other methods to show that they can be useful for estimating structural effects. On the other hand, the article only focuses on partially linear and instrumental variable models, so it would also be a good idea to extend that range of economic models and show whether the lasso penalty is useful in them.
