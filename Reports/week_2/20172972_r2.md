## What is the research question of the article? 

The research question is, through methods for high dimensional sparse (HDS) regression models like l1-penalization, identify and search the set of main regressors and estimating their coefficient. Also, in this article describe every little step of key theorical results. So, the main question is explain the methods for diferent scenarios where exist a large number of covariates, wich is the main problem for the authors.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
\
The strength to answering the research question is the authors explanation because the authors explain every single detail and error or problem that the HDS model or l1-penalization can have. 
Also, the literature that the authors mention in this paper is very important to understand that exist solutions for some estimation or theorical result problems. On other hand, the authors combinate very well the theorical and the empirical examples to do the paper more understandable. 
\
\
The weaknesses is that the authors explain a lot of terms which are not understandable for persons who don't have a high statistic knowledge or high matematics knowledge, and for this reason maybe some readers can be miss in this paper. 
\
## How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
\
The document contribution is to go deeper in one of the problems that some reseraches has which is be sure when they estimate a large numbers of covariates. Because the paper explain very well the different scenarios and the best methods that the research can chose to estimate a high numbers of regressors and to know what factors are more relevant than others.     
\
## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
\
In the conclusion the auhors mention the next step to move forwrad that is show another approach to dealing with the main problem. 
In my opinion, anothe step could be describe more deep the literature that i mention above, because this literature is just mention it by the authors but they don't explain the literature view. This step can add more details and knowledge to the paper.
