•	What is the research question of the article?
The article reviews estimation methods for HDS models that make use of the $l_1$ penalization.
In that sense, the research question is the following: Are $l_1$ penalization methods useful in these models?

•	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?
I find that the strengths of the paper rely on its ability to detailly explain the sparse and approximately sparse regression model and the estimation methods: $l_1$ penalized and post $l_1$ penalized. Also, the use of examples, and particularly, the use of the Monte Carlo simulations help the reader to have a better understanding of the contrast between the models. However, some of the notation can be a little harsh on a non-familiarized lector as well as the large number of mathematical equations. This article aims to get to an audience who is familiarized with this advanced notation. 

•	How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)
This paper not only introduces the lector to HDS models, such as the instrumental variables model and the partially linear model, but it also presents a set of novel inference results for these models and illustrates their use with applications to returns to schooling and growth regressions. 
Additionally, the authors conclude than $l_1$ penalization methods may be usefully employed in these models and can complement tools commonly employed by applied researchers.

•	What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?
As the authors mention it will be interesting to consider and understand the behavior of other methods for estimating structural economic objects. As well as, extending HDS models and methods to other types of economic models beyond those considered in the article. And it would also be interesting to consider efficient use of high-dimensional data in cases in which scores are not independent across observations which is a much-considered case in economics.
