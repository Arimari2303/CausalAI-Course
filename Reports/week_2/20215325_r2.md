This article discusses how to estimate high-dimensional sparse regression models since this model assumes the existence of a very parsimonious set of regressors, but how to identify them is unknown. Furthermore, the article emphasizes that the methods to identify approximations to this regressor can be inefficient. The research question is: Do exact or approximate HDS models make sense in econometric applications? This includes how to estimate and if they make sense in economic science, since one of the reasons for not finding regressors is The researcher's interpretation is when predicting events.

The strength of this article is that it explains the motivation for solving the problem of models with a large number of regressors and a moderate or small number of observations. Also, this article places the notation before all equations, rather than in the middle of them, to make it easier to explain your arguments. Then, theoretical and empirical examples of solving equations step by step are given. I have not identified relevant weaknesses, it could be the rigor of mathematics that can make it tedious to understand and read for those who are just starting out in econometrics.

The contributions are the explanations about the types of models in which the absence of a regressor can be corrected and when not; furthermore, it mathematically explains the lasso properties of an example model to minimize the approximation to the search for the regressor. Another contribution was that the authors incorporated research from other authors to highlight the main ideas and review the current literature. In general, show guidelines for the proper use of experimental variables.

The article is interesting because it answers the research question and opens the possibility of being able to improve by adding data in cases where the scores are not independent between the observations, which is a situation that occurs in economics.
