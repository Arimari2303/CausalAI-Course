In this article, different methods are proposed to estimate high-dimensional sparse econometric models (HDS), which is a model used in situations where the number of regressors is large (and even larger than the sample size), since this model allows us to to find a set of representative regressors that capture the main features of the regression function. 

But how do we select this set of regressors? This is where the contribution (and stregnth) of the article begins. Before starting with the mathematical explanation, the authors carry out an exhaustive literature review. In this section, the concepts of sparse and approximately sparse regression models are explained and examples are provided to demonstrate that the HDS model makes sense in econometric applications. Then, the main estimation methods of the model are presented, and it is found that the ℓ1 penalization methods  (Lasso Based) may be the best estimation method in these models. This conclusion is supported by simulations, empirical examples and econometric theory.

On the other hand, one of the limitations of this way of estimating the large-dimensional sparse model can occur when there are groups with correlated characteristics. It is possible that using this method not all the relevant characteristics of the bases are chosen within the set of selected variables.

This is why the next steps should be to apply these high-dimensional sparse econometric models using other high-dimensional databases, in order to determine if this ℓ1 penalization method is still the best estimation method or there are other methods  that generate better results.
