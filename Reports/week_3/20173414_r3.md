The first chapter of the book focus on giving an introduction to inferential causality in a formal way, while the second chapter focus on presenting the history of the theorization of causal inference from the main academics perspective. The authors start their book by stating that there is some aversion from the academic sphere to call causal statements despite the need of those statements for scientific research. The authors argue that is due to a lack of formal procedures and misinterpretation. 
To find causality one must observe the difference in the units between a treatment group and a control group. Nevertheless, this observation is often less obvious since that unit could be exposed to another treatment at the same time. The important point is, however, that causal statements become more clearly defined when the intervention on the unit is more precisely articulated, so that the is no ambiguity. 
The key element on comparing two different scenarios (treatment vs control) is that the observer doesn’t know the real effect of the control group if it wouldn’t be treated. That is the information is incomplete. To solve this one must compere potential outcomes instead of observed ones.  The causal effect of the treatment involves the comparison of these two potential outcomes. Thus, the researcher also needs multiple units to test the causal inference. 
The authors present the SUTVA assumption which states that the potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units, and, for each unit, there are no different forms or versions of each treatment level, meaning there are only a limited defined outcome instead of levels of outcomes.  
Another important point when estimating inferential causality comes when how to define the treatment group. It is important ha this selection is randomized to avoid bias results. In order to draw valid causal inferences, we must consider why some units received one treatment rather than another, that is, observe the assignment mechanisms. 
Despite these formal presentation on the original book, the authors argue that this process was introduced in 1923 by Neyman and later formalized by Fisher. The three main contributions of Neyman are: (i) explicit notation for potential outcomes, (ii) implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption, and (iii) implicit consideration for randomized assignment of units in for the treatment group. Later Fisher formalized the third contribution by explicitly demanding the assignment mechanisms.
