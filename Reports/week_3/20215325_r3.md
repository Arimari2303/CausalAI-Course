## Lecture Chapter 1 Casuality: The Basic Framework and Chapter 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

Both chapters discuss the topic of causal inference. In the first chapter, we are introduced to a basic framework for causal inference and the assignment mechanism, it talks about how causality is used by people making informal inferences, which is only part of what causality itself is. . The implicit question of the article is how to define causality and what aspects should be considered. In the second chapter, a recount is made of the contributions of various academics, who incorporated the approach of potential results to causal inference.

The first chapter deals with three main ideas:
- The potential result, which is defined as the result of a unit subjected or not to a treatment. Thus, the chance effect of a treatment is the difference between these two potential outcomes at the same time (with treatment and without treatment); to estimate casual inference, it is necessary to compare observed potential outcomes since without potential outcomes causal inference is not possible.
- The assumptions that the treatment of one unit does not affect the potential outcome of another and the idea that for each unit there is a unique version of each level of treatment. These assumptions are known as the stable unit treatment value (SUTVA) assumption.
- And finally, the assignment mechanisms, where it is necessary to know which unit should be in the control or treatment group. These groups are formed to deal with the problem of missing data.

The second chapter focuses on the contributions of several academics, where it is mentioned that during the 20th century very little was said about the possible results, however, it was not until Neyman where this theoretical proposal was formalized through the mathematical notation that he growth. . This was his most notable and therefore most explicit contribution. Through this input, Neyman had two other inputs that were implicit: the assumption of stability and the assignment of treatments to units corresponding to the completely randomized experiment. These last two contributions were complemented by Fisher and Rubin. In 1925, Fisher proposed randomized experiments to determine causal inference. Finally, Rubin (1974) made two key contributions, the first by making potential results relevant in the analysis of causal effects, regardless of whether the study was experimental or observational; furthermore, he introduced potential results in the debate on the transfer mechanism.
The advantages of the article is that it proposes examples to explain the causality, the most didactic example was that of taking or not an aspirin to relieve the headache is key because through it the issues related to the causality are explained: respective potential results to each decision, the importance of monitoring multiple individuals and how they are treated. In addition, he gives a space for an article to develop each characteristic, emphasizing that certain characteristics are not always fulfilled, such as the fact that the observation units are not related (SUTVA section). Another advantage of the article is that it places equations to explain more about the subject and not stay only in textual theory. Another advantage of the article is that it places equations to explain more about the subject and not stay only in textual theory. One disadvantage that the article could have is that it does not include an empirical example of causality resulting from an experimental exercise, as there are many in the literature. The article is a frame of reference to explain causality, it provides intuition of the basic conditions when one wants to study regressions between variables, but the article does not mention it because it tries not to address many technicalities as it is shown by placing everyday examples; is a good article for that reader who likes inferential statistics and wants to learn more about the real effect of some variables on others.
As presented in the document, the objective of this work is to learn about causal estimation, as well as the contributions that have been made over time on this topic.
