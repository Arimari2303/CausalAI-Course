## Ch 1 Casuality: The Basic Framework & Ch 2: A Brief History of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

In the two chapters of the document, causal inference is discussed. Where in the first chapter, topics such as bring us closer to a basic framework for causal inference and assignment mechanism. In the second chapter, a historical account is made of the contributions of various academics, such as Neyman (1923), Fisher (1925), and Rubin (1974), who allowed the incorporation of the potential outcomes approach to causal inference.

Specifically, in the first chapter, three fundamental notions are discussed: 
- The potential outcome, which is defined as the result of a unit subjected or not to a treatment. Thus, the casual effect of a treatment is the difference between these two potential outcomes at the same time (with treatment and without treatment); to estimate the casual inference, it is necessary to compare the observed potential outcomes since without the potential outcomes it is not possible the causal inference.
- The assumptions that the treatment of one unit does not affect the potential outcome of another and the idea that for each unit there is a unique version of each level of treatment. These assumptions are known as the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA).
- And finally, the assignment mechanisms, where it is necessary to know which unit should be in the control or treatment group. These groups are formed to deal with the problem of missing data.

The second chapter focuses on the contributions of several academics, where it is mentioned that during the twentieth century, very little was said about the potential results, however, it was not until Neyman where this theoretical proposal was formalized through the mathematical notation that he developed. This was his most notable and therefore explicit contribution. Through this contribution, Neyman had two other contributions that were implicit: the stability assumption and the assignment of treatments to units corresponding to the completely randomized experiment. These last two contributions were complemented by Fisher and Rubin. In 1925, Fisher proposed randomized experiments to determine causal inference. Finally, Rubin (1974) made two key contributions, the first making potential outcomes relevant in the analysis of causal effects, regardless of whether the study was experimental or observational; moreover, he introduced potential outcomes into the debate on the mechanism of assignment.

As presented in the document, the aim of this work is to learn about causal estimation, as well as the contributions that have been made over time on this topic.
