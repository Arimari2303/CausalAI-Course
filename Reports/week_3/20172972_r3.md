## Chapter1: The basic framework 

### 1.1 Potential outcomes
- Informal way of causal lenguages is when the cause information is about past observation. Then, the authors explain the formal causal lenguage. 
- The causality aproach is tied to an unit action. 
- Every unit is subjective because the unit can chose between treatments (example of the headache and take or not an aspirin).
- Every each unit action have potential outcomes, and is just the potential outcome corresponding to the action actually taken and the others outcomes cannot be observed. 
- The causal effect is the comparation between outcomes. 
- "Because" statement: when a researcher compares concepts of the potential outcomes. 
- In some cases exist a lot of because statements and those cases could do treatment or potential outcomes murky.
- So, the causal statements become more clearly defined by more precisely articulating the intervention that would have made the alternative potential outcome the realized one. 

### 1.2 Definition of causal effects 
- In the example of headache the treatments are: aspirin or not aspirin. For those treatments the causal effect happens when:  
    - Headache gone only with aspirin: 
        Y(aspirin) = No headache, Y(no aspirin) = Headache. 
    - Headache gone only without aspirin: 
        Y(aspirin)= Headache, Y(no aspirin) = No headache
- Important aspects of the definition of causal effect: 
    - The definition of causal effect depends of the potential outcomes, not just of the observable outcome. 
    - The causal effect is the comparation of potential outcomes fot the same unit at the same moment. 
- For estimation or inference is necessary have more than one unit and observe the potential outcomes.

### 1.3 Causal effects in common usage 
- The diference between the potential outcome that was not realized and the realized potential outcome is the being of causal effect. 

### 1.4 Learning about causal effect: multiple units
- To make causal inference is necessary multiple units. 
- Nevertheless, when the causal effect affect in the same way in the time and units, the researchers might thing that the outcome is the same for all units and any time. This is a informal assessment. 
- And the multiple units not resolve the informal assessment problem or causal inference problem. The reason is that the multiple units can be diferent between them. 

### 1.5 The stable unit treatment value assumption
- SUTVA: 
    - No interference: Assuming that the treatment applied to one unit does not affect to the outcome for other units.
    - No hidden variations of treatments: A unit cannot receive another form of treatment different to the especific treatment. Every unit and every treatment might be well-defined function to the potential outcome be clear.
- Alternative to SUTVA:
    - Exist complications when a researcher use more than one unit: 
        - An unit can interfere with another unit.
        - Can exist more than one unit with the same treatment, this can do that the outcome vary for this units. 
    - Is not true that one treatment applied to one unit does not affect to the outcome for other unit.

### 1.6 The assignment mechanism: an introduction
- Assignment mechanism: depending to the context, how treatment an unit has to receive. If the researcher don't know how treatment applied to an unit, the reseracher can commit a inference causal problen: missing data. 
- Missing data problem: given the wrong treatment assigned to an individual unit, the potential outcome associated with the correct treatment is missing. 

### 1.7 Atributes, pre-treatment variables or covariates
- Before to do a prediction is important assume or do a mechanism that permit do a comparation between the diferent units. For example, to predict an estimation for the headache is better know the intensity of the headache before the treatment.
- Pre-treatment variables: This mechanism solve the missing data problem because to the different covariates has before a treatment assigment. 
- Pre-treatment variables = covariables.
- The information available in these covariates can be used for: 
    - The covariables explain the outcome variation. 
    - Through the covariables is better divide the population in subgroups and apply a pre-treatment.
    - The characteristics from covariables may be relationated with the potential outcomes. 

### 1.8 Potential outcomes and Lord's Paradox.
- For causal inference is important do assumptions to make outcomes or conclusions. 
- The authors show an example where the researchers try to estimate the weight of university students by sex. Using covariables like sex, and initial weight (september weight). For this assessment, the treatment is monitoring by a control diet treatment or university diet treatment. 
- The paradox is that there is not the difference between control diet or university diet to estimate. Otherwise, the researches just use the university diet treatment. 
- The paradox solution is use potential outcomes or assume use university or control diet. 

### 1.9 Causal Estimands
- In this part the authors put the variables mentioned it before in a formal way.
- Unit-level causal effect: Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
- Causal Estimand: (1/N)Sum(i=1 -> N)[Yi(1)-Yi(0)]
- To do subgroups is important partly in terms of potential outcomes and focus on more general functions of potential outcomes. 

## 2. A brief history of the potential outcomes approach to cause inference. 

- Mill was one of the pioners of the knowledge about potential outcomes definition of causal effect. After him, Fisher contributed. 
- Neyman contributions:
    - Explicit notation for potential outcomes. 
    - Implicit consideration of something like the stability assumption. 
    - Implicit consideration of a model for the assignment of treatments to units that corresponds to the completely randomized experiment. 
- The randomization was to create sequences like what changes the experimenter was likely to choose. 
- Fisher contributes to randomize treatments to units with the agricultural experiment where the randomization was a prerequisite to treatment of results.
    - Fisher developed a distinc method of inference based (assignment mechanism) and it was randomized experiments.
- At firs, the statisticians not used to use randomized studies for causal effect. 
- Rubin (1974) puts the potential outcomes center stage in the analysis of causal effect and he discusses the assignment mechanism in terms of the potential outcomes.
