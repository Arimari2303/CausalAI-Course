In the first chapter the authors develop some basic concepts of causal inference: potential results, causal effect, the causal effect of multiple units, the Stable Unit Treatment Assumption (SUTVA), and important aspects for a correct causal inference. Below I will list each important part of the chapter.

1. What is a potential result? A potential result is the effect of a particular action applied to a unit. An action is considered as treatment or manipulation in causal language. While a unit can be a set of people or objects, or an individual person or a physical object.
Therefore, applied an action we can only observe a potential result. The other possible results are not observed because the actions that would lead to them have not been executed.

2. The causal effect of the treatment is the comparison of the potential results, for the same unit, the moment after the treatment. There will only be causality when it is certain that a certain action led to a result (that is, that without that action we would have a different result).

3. The fundamental problem, as you can see, is that we can only observe one result in a unit (by applying the assigned treatment) and the other potential result would be missing under the other treatment or action to determine what the pure effect of the treatment is to evaluate.
The impossibility of carrying out two treatments for a unit at the same time leads us to the following: consider multiple units and compare their results. That is, some units will be exposed to the treatment that we want to evaluate and other units will be "not exposed to the treatment" to determine the pure effect of the treatment or action. (Those units must be comparable.)

4. To correctly estimate causal effects when dealing with different units, it is important to take into account the Stable Unit Treatment Assumption (SUTVA) which states the following: First, results are not affected by actions performed on other units . Second, a unit receiving a treatment cannot receive different versions of that treatment.

5. Finally, for an adequate inference, the following must be taken into account: the assignment mechanism is the process by which it is determined which units will be exposed to treatment, and which will be the control units. Also, knowing the covariates that will accompany the inference that can affect the potential result and the assignment mechanism. Finally, the role of randomization at the time of assignment to capture the causal effect and not fall into bias.

The second chapter is a review of the development of techniques and contributions generated in causal inference over time. This chapter begins by mentioning Jerzey Neyman as the first to formally introduce the term "potential outcome" in 1923. Then, from this first contribution, the work of Fisher in this field appears (1925), who continued with the discussion and proposed perform randomized experiments to determine causal inference. The chapter ends by mentioning the contribution of Rubin, who defined the concept of unit-level causal effect in terms of potential outcomes in 1974.
