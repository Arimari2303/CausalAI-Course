## 1. Causality: The Basic Framework

One of the most important issues discused here is the difference between correlation and causality. The authors mention that causality refers to the evaluation of the consequences of an action applied to an specific unit, while a correlation is just a simple association between two variables. When talking about units, it is emphasized that an individual in a different time is a different unit, recalling on the fact that a person caractheristics' can vary over time, and therefore his responses to the same action (treatment) can vary over time, too.

In a more specific sense, the definition of causality refers to the comparison between the effect of one action or treatment to a unit "x" with the potential outcome (not realized), if this action had not been applied to the same unit "x". The problem, in practice, is that we **cannot** observe the two outcomes for the same unit: this is refered to as the "Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference". 

To overcome this issue, in principle, it is necessary to have multiple units, some of whom will not be subject to the treatment (control). Nevertheless, we must consider that to be able to assess results appropriately, the units must be relatively comparable ex-ante, that is, we must minimize the differences between both gorups (treatments and controls).

Besides this, there are some (sometimes plausible) assumptions that Causal Inference takes for granted, like the so called **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)**. The two main features of this assumption are that i. The treatment of one unit does not affect the outcome of other units (No interference) and ii. A unit cannot receive different degrees of treatment. This two assumptions assure that the potential outcome is well defined. However, it is not realistic to assume that this two features will *always* be true. In fact, when using multiple units, we could imagine scenarios where units 
interfere with each other, generating correlation in their results.

For estimation, it is also critical to make assumptions about how is determined which units get treatments and which others do not, that is, we need to know the missing data mechanism or assignment mechanism. To overcome this, and to be able to predict the causal effect of a treatment for a particular unit, we could consider the presence of pre-treatment variables, or covariates. This variables are unit-specific background attributes, that let us "divide" the population in subgroups to apply a pre-treatment, and see the group-specific causal effect. This latter property is specially useful for appropiately assessing the effect of a treatment in a sample that has individuals with different background characteristics.



## 2. A brief historiy of the Potential Outcomes Approach to Causal Inference

There were many authors that contribute to the literature about causal effect. One of the first ones was Mill (1973), who required, in his statement, a "constant conjunction", in order to assign causality. Later, Neyman (1923) made several contributions, like stating an implicit consideration of a model to assign treatment in a randomized way, or making an explicit notation for potential outcomes. In a similar spirit, Fisher contributed to this literature in an agricultural experiment where randomization was a prerequisite to treatment, in order to get appropriate results.
