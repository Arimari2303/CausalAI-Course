## Causality: The Basic Framework
First of all, causality is related to an action, for example treatments, applied to a unit or many units. It is important to highlight the same unit at different time is considered a different unit. There are two critical aspects to define a causal effect. The first one is that causal effects depends on the potential outcomes, but does not depend on the observed result. The second one defines causal effect as the comparison of potential outcomes for the same unit at the same time post-treatment. Taking this into consideration, the main problem of causal inference is the only one of the potential outcomes is realized and ,therefore, observed.

It is neccesary multiples units to learn causal effects, due to some will be exposed to the active treatment and the rest to the control treatment. This is supported by the the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), which points out the treatments applied to specific units do not affect another unit's outcome. Moreover, SUTVA states that there is a single version of the treatment. These two assumptions are exclusion restrictions because they based on external information out of the causal effect.

On the other hand, the crucial question is the following: which units gets which treatments? It is about to decide what potential outcomes are realized, which refers to the assignment mechanism. For this, missing potential outcomes are imputed to estimate the causal effect because only one potential outcome is realized for each unit. To predict the casual effect it is helpful to consider the covariates (e.g. age,education, etc)
