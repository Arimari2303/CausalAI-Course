### The main objective of the work is to develop a methodology that allows to identify the key variables that explain an economic phenomenon in contexts where the amount of available data is very large, therefore, the authors use the Lasso method to select a subset of relevant variables and improve the accuracy of the estimates. Then, the high dimensionality in econometric models that traditional methods cannot handle due to the excessive number of variables. Thus, only significant regressors within a wide list of possible predictors show valid and robust inferences. In this case, the work manages to select .the most relevant variables through penalty methods and thus manages high-dimensional econometric models.
### The strength of the work lies in the use of l1 penalty methods, such as Lasso, which are effective for variable selection in high-dimensional settings, as, as already mentioned, it allows for the identification of a parsimonious set of regressors. The authors also provide key theoretical results regarding estimation and inference in high-dimensional sparse models. Empirical exemplifications showing the practical applicability of their methods in real-world economic contexts are also highlighted.
### However, the work also has shortcomings, as in cases with many weak signals, the sparsity assumption may provide a poor approximation, potentially leading to biased estimates. Furthermore, the reliance on simulation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods may raise questions about the generalizability of the results to real-world data
### The contribution of the authors' work is to advance the field of econometrics, specifically in the analysis of high-dimensional sparse models, through contributions such as handling situations where the number of potential regressors exceeds the sample size, exploring the implications of imperfect regressor selection, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods, basing their theory on real contexts.But their main goal is to make valid inferences and provide a methodological framework to face the challenges of big data analysis.
### To further advance the research question on high-dimensional sparse econometric models and the use of l1 penalty methods, it would be interesting to do more comparative analysis of various penalty techniques beyond the l1 penalty, such as the Ridge penalty seen in class, to determine the performance of these methods in terms of variable selection accuracy.
### One could also improve the variable selection methods by investigating new techniques that further minimize the problems related to imperfect regressor selection or one could extend the methods to nonlinear models.
