The paper focuses on the use of High Dimensional Sparse Models applied to econometrics. High-dimensional model refers to cases where, for a sample of size ( $n$ ), the set of regressors or covariates ($p$) is larger than the number of observations ($n$). At first glance, this problem may seem complex and is not addressed in classical econometric theory. However, by assuming *sparsity*—the idea that, although the model may include many regressors, only a small subset is truly relevant—it becomes possible to manage this situation. The challenge is that the important regressors are unknown. In order to handle this regression, we have to use ( $l_1$ ) (Lasso) penalization and other techniques to obtain good approximations.

The main question the paper addresses is: How can we handle high-dimensional data regression in economics using high-dimensional-sparse models? The paper presents several applications in economic models, such as an instrumental variables model and a growth model, clearly demonstrating how these approaches are used in practice.

One of the strengths of the paper is the clarity and precision with which it explains how the assumptions allow complex problems to be solved through novel mathematical methods. However, a potential weakness is that the assumption of *sparsity* may not always be an accurate representation of reality. It would be beneficial to explore more general methods that do not rely solely on this assumption.

This paper advances knowledge by presenting multiple examples of how these innovative methods can be applied in the economic field. However, I agree with the authors that it would be valuable to delve deeper into their use in areas like time series analysis (macroeconomics), where the relationships between observations over time play a crucial role.
