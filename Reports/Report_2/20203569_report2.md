## Report 2: INFERENCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE ECONOMETRIC MODELS 


### Student: Charles Sánchez Salas 


The article’s aim is estimating and inferencing methods for high dimensional sparse regression models. In these models, there are many regressors, but only a small-and unknown- set of them are relevant for capturing the main features of the regression function. 

To answer the question, the paper clearly explains and justifies the use of the ℓ1 penalization over the ℓ0 penalization in the sparse methods. This step allows to understand how these methods select the relevant variables in a regression. Furthermore, the authors try to identify different types of sparse methods in terms of their level of penalty, reduction of bias and feasibility. The most important sparse methods are: Lasso, Post-Lasso, Square-root Lasso, Iterated Lasso and double-post-lasso. Each method has theoretical justification. On the other hand, these methods show efficiency selecting and estimating parameters in cases of heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian disturbances, as well as in instrumental variable models. The double-post-lasso has been designed to estimate the effect of a treatment without compromising robustness of the model.  Finally, the authors prove empirically the efficiency of this methods in two cases: returns to schooling and economic growth. 

The main weakness of this paper is that the authors don’t prove empirically the efficiency of all the models. Most of them were tested through simulations, which reduces the validation of the methods. On the other hand, the authors emphasized that their invention (the double-post-lasso) can work well for a wide variety of sequences of data-generating process, but not for all of them.  

Considering the explanation above, this paper aid to understand different kinds of methods that are useful to classify relevant variables in high dimensional models, their theoretical foundations and their advantages and disadvantages. For the last, the authors create a method that allows to estimate the effect of a treatment, reducing the complexity of the model, without compromising the robustness of the effect.
