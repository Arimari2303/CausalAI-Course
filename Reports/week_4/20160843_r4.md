### 1. What is the research question of the article?

The main question of the article is how to determine the appropriate covariates to include in a regression analysis, in order to get an unbiased parameter (or parameters) of interest. 

### 2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

The authors correctly identify the problems that arise in trying to isolate the effect of a variable or set of variables in another variable of interest (uncertainty about which covariates to include to eliminate the ommited variable bias and limited sample size). In response to that, and in order to overcome these problems, they present a simple but also efficient method, the Double Lasso Regression, that can help to select these covariates from a broader group of variables. Also, using simulations, the paper makes a very complete comparison between Double Lasso and other regression methods (No covariates, all covariates, p-hacking, etc), showing the goodness of fit (RMSE) and gains in statistical power of the former. Finally, the authors introduce Double Lasso to the analysis of relationships between variables discussed in the literature, where there was no consensus before.

Under my point of view, an important weakness of the paper is that it does not explicitly discuss (although it would have been a good idea to do so) the calibration of the lambda-penalty parameter, which is crucial to understand how does the Lasso method sets some coefficients to zero and "selects" others.

### 3. How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)

The main contribution of the article is presenting a simple, yet efficient, method to overcome the ill-posed problem of selecting which covariates to include in a regression, in order to isolate the effect of an independent variable of interest on another dependent variable, and to overcome the ommited variable bias. 

The document also advances on the knowledge about the question by comparing the bias, MSE, and statistical power of the presented method with other possible ones, and by identifying the advantages of the former. It also anaylizes actual-real life econometric questions with Double Lasso, in which there was no consensus before, and therefore contributing to define relationship between variables of interest.

### 4. What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

The next step to move forward on the question of interest is to present the robustness of the Double Lasso method under different calibrations of the penalization parameter lambda.
