The article presents the double lasso method to solve the problem of too many covariates in the data set. It can be related that covariate controls by researchers may denote "p-hacking" and biased results. Thus, the double lasso offers a rigorous method for a better selection of variables for the regressions. To demonstrate the scope of the double-loop method, the authors apply it to four data sets from 4 different studies and demonstrate its usefulness in variable selection in both correlational analyzes and experimental designs. This approach helps answer the question of how useful this method is in the field of research.

A strength is present in the first part of what is the researchers' problem (use of covariates) and the main method they use (randomization), to explain why randomization might fail and the lack of better methods than randomization. This would be a good strength to introduce the reader to why the Double Loop Method is such an important method.
Another of the main strengths of the article is the use of the replication of previous studies that did not use the double-loop method to select the covariates of the studies. In this way, the authors compare the results of the original study and use the double-loop method. In the first analysis, it helps to identify whether there is sufficient empirical justification for including published covariates and interactions between covariates. The second analysis shows that the double bind helps to determine the mediator as the correct one if it is sensitive to a more complete model. The third analysis shows that double tying reduces the probability of including spurious covariates. Finally, the fourth analysis showed that the double loop helps to test whether the randomization of the data was successful.
On the other hand, the article does not expand on the fact that lasso estimates cannot determine which variables make logical sense within the theoretical domain.

This article contributes as a simple and well-explained guide on the benefits of using the double-loop method on large data sets and empirical research. It answers the question about what are the benefits of this method by replicating previous empirical studies to show the scope of the method.

It is important to think about what the variables selected after the double lasso mean for the investigation, so that it helps a better interpretation of the regression results.

Thus, whether the relationship between life satisfaction and parenting was significantly positive, not significantly, or significantly negative depended on whether and which covariates were included. An important consideration is whether potential covariates should be considered controls, for theoretical and logical reasons (eg, rather than analyzed as potential mediators). Assuming that the variables are valid potential controls, it is not clear which covariates should be included and what conclusion should be drawn.
Double lasso addresses this concern by identifying whether there is sufficient empirical justification for including published covariates and potentially identifying other covariates.
