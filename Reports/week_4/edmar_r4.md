This paper analyzes the importance of controlling for covariates and how failure to do so can lead to biased parameter estimates in correlational analyses or randomised experiments. To this end, the authors propose Double-Lasso regression as a variable selection tool.

Some of the strengths of the paper are the way in which it is presented and the importance of the proposed method. First, the authors present the problems caused by variable selection. Then, they present the double lasso as a solution to this problem.  Secondly, the double loop method solves a problem efficiently.

Additionally, the authors use this method in psicological research, where there are a lot of variables and can be some correlation among them, and test their method and compare the results with different methods where they demonstrate the importance of the method for selecting accurate models.

In this sense, the authors contributes to the related literature by demonstrating the potential benefits of using the Double-Lasso to select covariates.

I think the next step would be to replicate the regressions with different datasets with application to other fields, as well as to compare this method with the latest methods that exist.
