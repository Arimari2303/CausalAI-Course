# **Report 4: Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection - Urminsky, Hansen and Chernozhukov**
**Names: Claudio CÃ©sar Cabrera Young**

## 1. **What's the research question of the paper?**
The research question of the paper is the following: Which is the best method to control for covariates, and to select which covariates to include?

## 3. **How does this paper develop the knowledge regarding the answers for such research question?**

They introduce the double-lasso method as a method that performs much better than other methods that were commonly used at the time in the psychological research, thus broadening the possibilities for a better analytical control that achieves a lower bias for the effect of a focal variable on a dependent variable of interest.

## 2. **What are the strenghts and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answer such research question?**

The  paper has at least four strengths./

The first strength is the authors' explanatory clarity at mentioning the context in which a good method for controlling for covariates and for covariates selection is needed. The second strength is the space for comparability of the double-lasso method that the authors bring to the reader by introducing several methods (i.e., p-hacking, stepwise regression, two-step multiple regression and double-forward-regression) to demonstrate the superior usefulness of the double-lasso method. The third strength of the paper is the re-analysis of the four datasets discussed in the literature. A fourth strength lies on the differentiation they highlight between sufficient empirical justification for including covariates and theoritical justification for including covariates, where double-lasso offers a path to achieve the former. Regarding this last point they write "While variable selection methods are no substitute for thinking about what the variables mean, the approach presented here can provide an empirical basis for determining which variables to think hard about".

## 4. **Which would be the next valuable and specific step or steps to advance toward richer answers for such research question?**

I don't have an answer for this question.
