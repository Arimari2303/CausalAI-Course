# Using Double-Lasso Regression for Principled Variable Selection
- What is the research question of the article?

In a context where researchers prefer not to control for covariates even when it could be beneficial for the investigation due to the lack of established methods for doing such analyses, the research question of the article can be formulated as follows: 

How to successfully overcome the covariate selection problem?

- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

The main strength I find is that the "double-lasso" method proposed by the authors addresses the main problems that researchers face when controlling for covariates. This method can help select variables for inclusion in analyses in a principled manner that avoids inflated Type I errors. It does so by introducing an additional penalty term that shrinks the estimated regression coefficients towards zero. This also allow Lasso regression to be used even when the number of observations is small relative to the number of predictors (another common issue when trying to control for covariates).

Another strength of the paper’s approach to answering the question is that it provides a simulation of double-lasso, and it compares its findings to another alternatives and methods. 

However, a much more detailed explanation about the choice of the parameter $\lambda$ is needed since it is very important for successfully avoiding over-fitting.  
- How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The contribution of this paper relays on the use of the double-lasso to show the benefits of this method, it does so by analyzing four datasets discussed in the literature.

The first one being the correlational analysis of parents’ life satisfaction. The paper concludes that Double-lasso variable selection confirms that there is sufficient empirical support to include the variables identified by Bhargava et al. (2014) (age, gender, marital status and income) as covariates.

The second dataset is used to analysis “conservative happiness”. The original conclusion was that conservatives demonstrate higher levels of subjective well-being than liberals do. However, using the double-lasso method the authors find that the proposed mediation in the original study is sensitive to the inclusion of a more complete set of covariates, which are identifiable using the double-lasso procedure.

The third analyzes a spurious experiment on chronological rejuvenation. In this case, the double lasso reduces the likelihood of including covariates. 

The last dataset comes from an experiment about donation. This time double lasso is used to test if the method can identify valid covariates in a randomized experiment, testing whether randomization was successful, and increasing the statistical power to detect a result.
- What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

In order to be able to generalize the conclusions of this paper, the next step would be to evaluate the double-lasso method using more challenging data, which would allow us to see if the method remains to be useful and better than other approaches under more complex conditions.
