# Report 4: Using double-lasso for Principled Variable Selection (Urminsky, Hansen, Chernozhukov)

## What is the research question of the article?

The autors want to explain a method to select the most important covariates to be included in a regression. This is important, because including more covariates than needed may bias the estimated parameters, and the conclutions will be wrong. This is very useful, because in many researchs, we obtain a large amount of covariates, and it is important to select the most relevant ones. In this paper, we use double-lasso regression to solve this potential problem of over-select spurious covariates that increases the error in the estimation.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?
The main strenght of the article is that is straightforward to the contexts where double-lasso can be applied. Also, details 4 examples using double-lasso regression and shows some tables that help to the analysis of the regression.
The main weakness is that the paper doesn't detail very much the theory behind double-lasso. It would be confusing for someone who hasn't seen any paper about lasso regression. Also, it would be great to explain the Stata /SPSS codes used for the regressions.


## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, it does. It explais very well 4 examples where double-lasso is used. All of this examples, the method is used to find the correct covariates to include in the regression to obtain correct estimators

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

The paper encourages more researchs using double-lasso, and is very helpful for those that want to re-analyse the results that already have been found. Next step, would be some guideline to obtain the optimal lambda, a very important parameter of the equation.
