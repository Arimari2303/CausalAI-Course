### Lecture: Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects
### Author: Victoria Olivera (20171137)

*	What is the research question of the article?

In this article, the research question is which are the methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies. In line with this question, the authors ask themselves which are the methods for conducting hypothesis tests (inference) about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. 

*	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper’s approach to answering that question?

Regarding the strengths, first, they use the ‘honesty’ approach (whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation) that places no restriction on model complexity. The ‘honesty’ approach allows overcoming the limitation of the adaptative methods. This limitation is that many existing machine learning methods cannot be used directly for constructing valid confidence intervals. The second strength is that they derive a partition of the population according to treatment effect heterogeneity using regression trees. In this way, their approach is tailored for applications where there may be many attributes of a unit relative to the number of units observed and without sparsity assumptions, and where the functional form of the relationship between treatment effects and the attributes of units is not known. 
The main weakness of the article is the cost of honest estimation. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7–22%.

*	How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article)

The article’s main contribution is to show that criteria for both constructing the partition and cross-validation change when we anticipate honest estimation.

*	What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

The next step to move forward is to support or be part of the growing literature that seeks to apply supervised machine learning techniques to the problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects. On the other hand, the researchers should apply the proposed methods. For example, the authors mentioned that a potentially important application of the techniques is to “data mining” in randomized experiments.
