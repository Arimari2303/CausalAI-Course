### What is the research question of the article?

The article proposes a methodology to study heterogeneity (caused by covariates) in treatment effects across subgroups from a given sample, as well as making inference about the possible differences that these treatment effects may have across the subgroups mentioned.

### What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

In my view, an important strength of the document is that, by using an approach that makes the estimation and selection procedures in different subsamples, the authors are able to reduce some bias present in the inference of heterogeneous causal treatment effects. Also, besides formally deriving its methodology, the article compares their method with other ones, and find that these other estimation methods lead to aggresive pruning, because they are noisier. Finally, and because of these last feature, the model can cover a wider confidence interval, whereas other methods (such as adaptative ones) have coverage rates that are substantially below their nominal rates.

A weakness is that, as the authors mention, there is a loss of precision in making an honest estimation, due to reduced sample size. This causes a  cost in terms of MSE, in comparison to other estimation procedures. 


### How does this document advance knowledge about the question, that is, what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

One of the most important contributions of the article resides in using data-driven methods to select covariates for controlling for heterogeneity across the sample. Besides, the authors also use an "honest" approach to estimate these treatment effects, which has the attribute of not using the same information for selecting the model structure and for estimating the ATE's. Although this in principle reduces the precision, it also eliminates bias due to estimation in an independent sample. 

### What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to move forward on this question?

As the authors mention, an important step would be to apply their honest methodology to an extensive group of studies about RCT's. In this regard, it would be possible to find subpopulations with a different treatment effect, not previously reported.
