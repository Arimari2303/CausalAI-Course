# I. Research proposal

The author proposes methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies, and for hypothesis testing the magnitude of differences in treatment effects in subsets of the population.

# II. Strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering the question
The strength of the paper's approach is that it allows valid confidence intervals to be made for treatment effects, even when it has many covariates with respect to sample size, and without assumptions of sparsity. Moreover, it is suited to cases where there may be many attributes of a unit relative to the number of units observed, and where the functional form of the relationship between treatment effects and unit attributes is unknown. On the other hand, the method they use is able to eliminate bias by honest estimation. 

# III. Contribution of the paper/ Reason for publication

The investigated method allows to identify heterogeneity in unspecified treatment effects, without the concern for invalidity as it is searched in many possible partitions. Furthermore, it shows that the criteria for partition construction and for cross-validation change when they anticipate an honest estimate. The authors use methods for constructing causal effect trees that allow valid inference of causal effects in randomised experiments and in observational studies that meet disconfirmity. On the other hand, these authors designed the research, conducted it and provided new tools for analysis, which encourages future researchers to experiment with new methods to improve estimates. While most take as given some methods from other authors, it is useful to create new methods or modify some methods to facilitate or improve the estimation results in an experiment. 

# IV. Next steps to advance the question
The authors could provide more cases applied in common life, as this article may be rather theoretical. On the other hand, it would be interesting if the authors would comment on how they created these methods.
