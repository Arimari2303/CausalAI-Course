## What is the research question of the article ?

* The implicit research question of the article is :  How using honest estimation helps decrease the high variance of building regression trees by taking into account the effect of heterogeneity in the sample?

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document to respond to that article ?

* The authors present examples through equations that address each intermediate point or step until reaching the final result, as well as compare results from various models and conclude that honest versions anticipate correct for bias in leaf estimates and therefore prune less; that is, a shallower tree that identifies which cut and in which variable is ideal for grouping the sample. Near the end of the article, the authors expose that maching learning tools, specifically, algorithms in this area are able to solve the problem of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects. Actually, the article does answer the question well and does so dynamically using equations and authors within the literature, but it would have been better if the article was more intuitive, because the mathematics can be a bit cumbersome.


## What is the contribution of the document on the progress of the topic in question ?

*  The contribution of the article is that it shows how the construction of classification and regression trees can be subject to great variance, but they estimate the causal effect of the heterogeneity of the sample and take into account that tools such as Random forest, Lasso, OLS, among others are approaches to address the problem, also the paper show a criteria for both constructing the partition and cross-validation change when we anticipate honest estimation.

## What would be one or two valuable or specific recommendations to advance this question ?

*  Computers actually do the calculations directly and it is important to distinguish the results, and above all to explain them simply to someone who does not handle the terms; therefore, it is necessary to explain that these tools are not only applicable to areas of study such as medicine or development economics, but can be applied to all social science in general and it would be a good next step to do studies using these tools in areas other than those mentioned above to show that the results have good productive capacity in every area.
