# Report 7:Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects (Athey, Imbens)

## What is the research question of the article?

The autors propose a new method for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects that is observed in datasets where the number of covariates are larger than individuals, and to measure the differences of the treatment across divided samples. To reach their objective, they propose a modification in the standard machine-learning regression trees, because the objective is to capture the causal effects and not the best predictions.

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the article in order to answer the question?
The main strenght of the article is the introduction of the "honest" method, modifying the classical machine learning procedure by adding a new split size that minimizes the variance in splitted groups. This modification changes the focus of the process: we don't want the best prediction, we want to know the causal effects of the treatment and infer the differences between subsamples.

The main weakness of the paper is that they not present any empirical research using their new approach. This would be excellent to prove the honest estimation.

## Does the article contribute in its academic field? If not, why did editors decide to publish it?

Yes, it does. Althoug it doesn't present any empirical research, they mention the possible usages of the honest estimation. Also, it gives new approaches in the machine learning methods, enforcing its importance.

## What would be the needed next steps to answer the question?

The next steps would be the empirical employment of the honest estimation in Medicine, Economics or Social Sciences researchs.
