The article addresses the question: How can valid inferences about low-dimensional parameters be made in the presence of high-complexity nuisance parameters, using machine learning methods to mitigate regularization bias and overfitting? To answer this, it proposes the use of Double Machine Learning (DML), a methodology that combines two key pillars: Neyman-Orthogonal Moments and Cross-Fitting. These techniques reduce bias and increase efficiency, resulting in estimators that concentrate around the true value of the parameter of interest. This challenges modern statistics, as traditional approaches rely on a variety of assumptions that are limited in their capacity to handle high complexity.

Additionally, DML methods are highly flexible because they do not rely on strict assumptions about the data, enabling the use of various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Lasso. The article contributes by establishing a generic framework for the estimation of ùúÉ_0, robust against the complexity of ùúÇ_0, and proposing a practical approach that relaxes traditional constraints, generalizing its application to contexts such as the estimation of average treatment effects.

However, one of its weaknesses is its sensitivity to the selection of ML methods and variability in sample partitions, which can affect results in small datasets. This sensitivity may lead to instability and hinder the reproducibility of estimations. While DML is robust in large samples, in small datasets the quality of ùúÇ_0, estimations may be insufficient due to the lack of data to capture complex patterns. This directly impacts the validity of the results and amplifies the risk of overfitting, even with cross-fitting, representing a challenge to improve its performance in the context of small datasets.

Among the highlighted future steps, it is suggested to explore adapting the method to more complex nonlinear configurations, big data scenarios where data dimensionality grows exponentially, and improving robustness in small datasets, thereby optimizing its implementation in practical applications.
