The article investigates how to conduct analysis on high-dimensional data, where there are many regressors, and the regression function is approximated by a parsimonious set. So, the article focuses on selecting relevant regressors and estimating their coefficients using ℓ1-penalization methods, with an emphasis on instrumental variables models and partially linear models.
There are several strengths of the article. First, using ℓ1-penalization methods allows for handling many covariates while identifying a sparse set of relevant regressors. This approach helps in selecting relevant regressors and estimating their coefficients. But why are penalization methods important? They help manage high-dimensional models by reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the interpretability of the results. Second, it provides novel inference results and empirical examples that demonstrate the practical applicability of HDS models in econometrics. It analyzes some contexts returns to education, allowing for the identification of a reduced set of significant variables from among many available; growth regression, by selecting relevant variables, it shows that robust inferences can be obtained even with many instruments; and applications are presented where many instruments are used to address endogeneity issues that shows the flexibility of HDS models. Finally, the approach is supported by simulations that validate the performance of the proposed methods, enhancing the robustness of the findings: 1000 repetitions of simulations, size and power control, and high-quality estimates. Together, these simulations strengthen confidence in the applicability and effectiveness of HDS models in econometric practice.
However, there are also some weaknesses. The approach relies heavily on ℓ1-penalization, which is just one of many methods available, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to other contexts. Although ℓ1-penalization is effective for variable selection and dimensionality reduction, its approach may not adequately capture the complexity of certain data, there are other methods that may offer better results in different contexts. Furthermore, alternative methods may have different in terms of bias and variance, that implies that results obtained may not be comparable in alternative methods. Additionally, the paper does not thoroughly explore alternative methodologies, which may provide different insights or results.
The article demonstrated that ℓ1-penalization methods may be usefully employed when dealing with high-dimensional data, as they allow the model to improve its ability to identify significant relationships in various contexts. Furthermore, it highlights the proposal of Post-Lasso to enhance Lasso models by removing, at least partially, the bias that ℓ1-regularized estimators have toward zero. As a result, these Post-Lasso estimators outperform Lasso estimators due to their lower shrinkage bias, meaning that Post-Lasso performs as well as or better than Lasso. So, this approach allows for more robust estimation by considering both the direct relationship between the dependent and independent variables as well as the influence of instrumental variables. Finally, although the article contributes to empirical evidence by showing simulations where Lasso penalization methods and its variants can improve estimation and inference in high-dimensional econometrics, the Lasso estimator has many properties of consistent estimation and proper rejection, even in contexts with many instruments. Additionally, the empirical results in growth analysis validate these methods.
One of the next steps to advance in this question would be to investigate and to make a comparative with other estimation methods in high dimensions like the article mentioned (Huang, Horowitz, y Ma; Fan y Li; Zhang; Fan y Liao), Another step is to extend the model for estimating structural economic objects to evaluate their applicability in different areas of economic investigation.
