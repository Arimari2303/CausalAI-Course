## What is the paper's research question?

- The papaer adresses the challengues of estimation in high dimensional sparse regression models in econometrics, where the number of potential regressors (p) can be much larger than the sample size (n), but only a small number (s) of these regressors are truly import for the interpretation of the results. This situation explores a relevant issue in the contemporary econometrics because of the versions of the datasets in the different topics of the economic problems. 

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

- Strengths:

This paper tackles a hihgly relevant and common problem in econometrics where datasets with many potential explanatory variables are very often in the research questions. The proposal of the author provides a theorical framework for understanding the propertires of penalization methods in HDS models. Also, the paper offers a partical guidance on implementing these methods and demonstrating their use in real world applications (by example of GDP and economic growth). The approach of the paper is applicable to a range of econometric models, expanding the toolkit for researchers. 

- Weakness:

I think the paper is technically demanding, which may limit its accesibility to researchers. In fact, I confess that it was quite difficult to understand some foundations on the penalization methods if you dont have some basics knowledge in econometrics first. 

## How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

I think this paper makes severel key constribution. It develops novel inference procedures for HDS models, adressing the challenge of imperfect model seletion particularly in context of instrumental variables and partially linear models. The proposal offers practical guidance on implementing these methods (shrinkage), including penalty choices and iterative algorithms for stimating the noise level. Also, i think the author achieves to explain himself demonstrating the applicability of HDS methods in empirical contexts, showing the potentiability of the path of adressing real - world economic questions. 

## What would be one or two valuable, specific next steps to advance this question?

To continue developing research questions in this topic its necesarry to extending the HDS framework to other clasess of econometric models, such as panel data models. These path need to be also usefull to answer other questions in the social sciences such as sociology and politcs, trying to combine the best approaches of cuantative research with the potential of the penalization in econometrics and how these can be helpfull in the other disciplines of computational social sciensce.
