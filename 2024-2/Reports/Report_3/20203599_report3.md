This paper presents, for the first time, a non-parametric method for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects. This method builds upon techniques such as nearest-neighbor matching, which has been enhanced by recent advances in machine learning, particularly through high-dimensional models like the random forest method developed by Breiman in 2001. As a result, it becomes possible to evaluate the effects of a given policy, accounting for the heterogeneity in the data.

One potential weakness of the paper is that the method used may encounter issues with relationships between covariates, which could affect the robustness of the results. Nevertheless, the contribution of this paper is a significant advancement in methods used for causal inference with heterogeneous data. This is highly beneficial for the field of economics, where we lack the controlled environments. 

The next step would be to generalize this method and explore additional variations or applications in several fields of economics. In other words, I think that the next step is to apply this method to studies that were previously limited by the constraints of existing methodologies.
