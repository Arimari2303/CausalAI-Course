### ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE OF HETEROGENEOUS TREATMENT - EFFECTS USING RANDOM FORESTS

Stefan Wager and Susan Athey address the question of how to obtain a reliable and accurate estimate of heterogeneous treatment effects. The authors develop an algorithm, called _causal forest_, that extends Breiman's random forest approach to obtain nonparametric causal inferences with valid confidence intervals. They propose the use of nonparametric methods in situations where covariates may be numerous and potentially irrelevant; where other methods such as nearest neighbor, kernel method and serial estimates are flawed. They make it clear that classical causal inference approaches are often inefficient when there are many covariates, thus generating evidence of the need for an alternative method to address this challenge.

The approach proposed by the authors is a powerful and flexible tool for causal inference in high-dimensional scenarios. One of its main strengths is its ability to handle a large number of covariates including those that may be irrelevant or do not contribute significantly to the prediction of the treatment effect. Whereas traditional matching or kernel-based methods tend to deteriorate rapidly when there are many irrelevant variables, the authors instead employ the random forest extension where the *causal forest* is specifically designed to handle this type of data to allow for accurate predictions and also generates asymptotically valid confidence intervals for treatment effects. The *causal forest* employs the principles of random forests, which can automatically detect which covariates are most relevant and adjust its modeling accordingly. This is achieved through the construction of multiple decision trees and the aggregation of their results, which allows capturing complex interactions between covariates without imposing strong assumptions on the structure of the data.

Another strength regarding the use of “honest” trees that divide the data into independent subsets to ensure that the model fit and the treatment effect estimate do not contaminate each other. This “honesty” principle helps to reduce bias in estimation and allows the results to be consistent and asymptotically normal. This is particularly important in practical applications, where statistical validity and the ability to generate accurate inferences are essential for making important decisions that will impact the real lives of many people.

In view of the benefits, it is important to recognize and identify the existence of limitations to be addressed in the future while recognizing the progress and opportunities for improvement in obtaining results. On the one hand, the theoretical tests of consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator may be considered by some as deficient because they are based on assumptions that may not always be met in practice (such as assuming that the treatment assignment is observable and controlled, _unconfoundedness_ ), although this does not diminish its importance because other theoretical tests go through the same; but it could limit the applicability of the *causal forest* in certain contexts. On the other hand, the requirement that the trees be honest, although this reduces bias, it is important to recognize that it does introduce a degree of complexity in the implementation of the method. Ensuring that the trees fit honestly may not be trivial in all applications. Given this, use is limited in specific cases where computational resources are limited, where the data set cannot be effectively partitioned, where the data may be noisier, biased or contain more complex structures than the controlled simulations used.

The paper makes a significant contribution as it proposes a new methodology and establishes a solid theoretical basis for the use of random forests in this type of problems; that is, it contributes to close a gap in the literature on causal inference in a high dimensionality context. Innovation in the use of random forests in favor of solutions in the field of causal inference. Prior to this work, random forests were mainly known as tools for prediction and classification in supervised learning tasks, but their application in causal inference had been limited due to the lack of a theory validating their use in this context. The authors did not limit themselves in extending the use of random forests for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects, but also provide theoretical tests that demonstrate that the estimators estimated by the *causal forest* are consistent and that their distributions are asymptotically normal.This theoretical advance is fundamental because it allows random forests to be used for rigorous statistical inference, which greatly expands their applicability in areas where data-driven decision making is critical. In addition, the ability to generate valid confidence intervals for heterogeneous treatment effects is a novel aspect that had not been addressed by previous random forest methods.

Although the *causal forest* represents an important advance, there are future steps related to the identified limitations to strengthen this new line of research. It would be valuable to explore risk situations in future applications where the data are more complex, noisy and less structured than in the simulations presented in the paper such as where the honesty of the trees is difficult to guarantee, or where the data cannot be effectively partitioned into independent subsets. This could involve the development of new techniques or certain adaptations that allow honest estimation of treatment effects in settings where the number of samples is small or where information is limited.
