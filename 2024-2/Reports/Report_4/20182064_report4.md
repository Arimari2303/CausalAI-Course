• What is the paper's research question?

The model aims to answer the question of what is the best model to predict Airbnb listing prices. To this end, the authors develop a reliable model that uses machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. The performance of several models is also compared, including linear regression, tree-based models, support vector regression (SVR), K-means clustering, and neural networks.

• What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper's approach to answering that question?

Unlike other studies on real estate price prediction, this work innovates by using more advanced learning models rather than the classic regression and classification models. On the other hand, those studies that did try more advanced models, such as SVR, neural networks, logistic regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression trees, did not yield strong results in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). For this reason, this research improves model methodology by focusing on variable selection techniques. Additionally, it implements neural networks and leverages customer reviews, which is an innovative approach in the literature.

• How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

One of the most important contributions of the paper is the addition of a categorical variable that captures sentiment analysis based on Airbnb property reviews. The average sentiment scores, ranging from [-1;1], were included as a feature in the model. Since the model was over-specified, a variable selection method was necessary. Thus, the second most important contribution is the use of Lasso for selecting relevant variables, which led to better prediction gains in the training set, achieving a higher R^2 in regression compared to other selection methods, such as lowest p-value or manual selection.

The variables selected using Lasso significantly reduced variance. After applying linear regression, Ridge regression, gradient boosting, K-means with Ridge regression, SVR, and neural networks, the R^2 scores across models showed only minor differences. Therefore, the contribution of Lasso covariate selection is evident in model adjustment. Finally, the best-performing model was SVR with an RBF kernel, which effectively handled the non-linearity of the data relationships. The use of these complex models is an important contribution for analyzing data with non-linear relationships like this.

• What would be one or two valuable, specific next steps to advance this question?

One significant advance mentioned by the authors is to explore more advanced variable selection models, such as random forest. However, I believe that Lasso demonstrated good efficiency in variance reduction in this study. Additionally, implementing more data from other lodging services could improve the training clusters. This would enhance the K-means clustering with Ridge regression model because a broader price frequency range could improve affinity selection within the model.
