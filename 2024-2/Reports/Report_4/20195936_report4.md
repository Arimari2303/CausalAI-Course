This article shows how to create a prediction model of prices to determine prices of Airbnb in different cities by using machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing technique with the objective to help property owners and customers to find a minimal available price. Furthermore, the article uses SVR, KMC and NNs for creating a predicting model.

There are some strengths. Model combines clustering methods and sentiment analysis, what allows understanding the factors that influence on prices of Airbnb. Also, it uses multiple techniques of selection of characteristics that can improve the precision of the model. However, there are some weaknesses. Model can be sensitive to biases in reviews or variability of prices of different cities, it depends on quality and number of data available. Also, interpretation of results can be difficult, because of the complexity of the approach.

This article contributes to improving understanding selection techniques of characteristics. The inclusion of categorical variables that captures sentiment analysis with punctuation and using Lasso model to select relevant variables. Also, it introduces innovative ways like the application of neural networks. All these things haven’t been explored before in existing literature, so this improves precision of model and reliability of predictions.

As the article concludes, future investigations could include studying other feature selection schemes like Random Forest, further experimenting with neural net architectures and getting more training examples from other hospitality services like VRBO.
