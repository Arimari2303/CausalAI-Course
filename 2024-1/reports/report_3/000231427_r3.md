## What is the research question of the article?

How can we estimate the regression function when confronted with a lot of regressors, 
but only a subset of them is essential for capturing the main features of the regression function?

## What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

Strenghts: It maintains a clear focus on the estimation and inference methods pertinent to high-dimensional sparse 
regression models while reviewing various relevant methodologies, enhancing comprehension for readers seeking a comprehensive
 understanding of the subject matter. Secondly, it provides real-world examples drawn from datasets commonly encountered in economic research. 
These empirical illustrations serve to solidify the understanding of the discussed methods and illustrate their applicability in 
real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses: One notable limitation is the lack of a thorough comparison between techniques suitable for high-dimensional data.
 While the document acknowledges alternative methods briefly, a more in-depth comparative analysis could offer valuable insights 
into the relative merits and drawbacks of each approach. 

## How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

This article makes significant contributions to advancing knowledge about estimation and inference in high-dimensional
 sparse econometric models. It presents novel inference results, particularly within the context of instrumental variables 
and partially linear models, which expand the existing body of knowledge in the field. Lastly, the inclusion of empirical 
examples serves to underscore the practical applicability of the discussed methods in econometric analysis, further solidifying
 their importance in real-world scenarios.

## What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

The author can explore the extension of HDS models and methods to other types of economic models beyond the instrumental
 variables and partially linear models considered in the article would broaden the scope of applicability of these techniques. 
Lastly, investigating methods for efficiently utilizing high-dimensional data in cases where scores are not independent across
 observations, which is common in economics but not explicitly addressed in the current article, could yield valuable insights
 into addressing this challenge effectively.
