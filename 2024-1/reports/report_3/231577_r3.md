## INFERENCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL SPARSE ECONOMETRIC MODELS

⮚The paper focuses on the development of estimation and inference methods for high-dimensional sparse regression (HDS) econometric models. 
These models arise in situations where a large number of regressors or series terms are available in larger numbers than the sample number. The main research question is how to efficiently identify the set of significant regressors and estimate their coefficients using the ℓ1 penalty.

⮚One of the strengths is the approach of high dimensional econometric techniques, 
such as Post-Lasso, Double Lasso or Oracle and the use of empirical and theoretical mathematical information to complement the understanding of the work.

⮚The paper's contribution to the topic is the presentation of literature from various authors and the different methods for each scenario (HDS, HD instruments, Treatment and structural effects) which broadens the range of options for economists to work with high dimensional data.

⮚A next step to follow is to continue the search for models that are applicable to the analysis of high dimensionality data, as the paper has only covered penalty methods for estimation, but there are other methods to be investigated.
