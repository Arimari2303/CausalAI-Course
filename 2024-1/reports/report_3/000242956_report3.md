# Report 1: Inference for high-dimensional sparse econometric models [Belloni et. al (2011)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0220.pdf)

## (1) What is the research question of the article?

The article explores some estimation and inference methods for high dimentional sparse (HDS) regression models, such as $l_1$-penalization. It also gives some examples for practical use in a setting with multiple instrumental variables (IV). 

## (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

One of the main strengths of the article's proposed method is the flexibility it has when it comes to choosing the optimal number of relevant regressors $s$. In particular, they allow for $s$ to increase as the sample size $n$ gets larger, which gives to the potential researcher much more freedom. Another strength is the inclusion of examples which can motivate empirical economists to considere these metehods in their research. 

The main weakness of the article is the high ceiling required to understand the article at a good level.  


## (3) How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

It advances knowledge in the sense that it discusses a new estimation method, with implications to empirical research on causal questions. It also covers inference methods and large sample properties, something that isn't always present in similar articles. 

## (4) What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

The next steps would be to consider different methods other than $l_1$-penalization. It's also important to keep exploring more applications so that these methods can impact the way empirical work is typically done in economics.
