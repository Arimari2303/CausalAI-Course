What is the research question of the article?

The research question focuses on HDS and how it is possible to find out about the regressors for a series which has few regressors that are parsimonious and optimal for the regression even with a large set of regressors in the dataset. Thus we wish to find out the "few" relevant regressors for our series.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

Generally, the sparse method can lead to precise estimation without the problems that could occur through normal regressions, we can make use of lasso and penalty based estimation in order to solve the oracle problem. 
It also shows that Lasso may have a bias towards zero that could affect our accuracy, however, not our consistency, this bias can be fixed by post-lasso and may be better for prediction. 

How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

The contribution of the paper is to show how it is possible to create a parsimonious regression when there are multiple amounts of covariates available as variables in a regression. 

What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
