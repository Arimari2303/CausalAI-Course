# This is the 2nd report due by Alvaro Yllu
What is the research question of the article?

The research question of the article relates to the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the optimal price for Airbnb rentals from the perspective of the owner. 

Besides that, it poses the question of whether or not the confidence interval is as important to the empiric research as theory suggests. This is due to the fact that there are no ways to create confidence intervals for machine learning just yet. 

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The approach of the report was to make use of cleaning datasets, together with separation of the training dataset and ensuring there were enough observations for an accurate assessment. Beyond that, they made a selection of artificial intelligence to pick the best features for the machine learning regressions. The lasso method Lasso proved to be the best when it came to R2 and prediction. It also showcased a variety of models and the way to choose the most efficient one for prediction. 

How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

It mostly showed that selecting the right amount of features could help reduce variance and increase the R2 without limiting the model too much. 

What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

In particular, it would be nice to show the lasso method with fewer variables to show how it interacts with a more limited dataset for a particular area.
