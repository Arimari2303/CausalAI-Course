⮚ What is the research question of the article?
Is there a better price prediction model for Airbnb using Machine Learning?

⮚ What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?
Strenghts: 
Feature analysis to improve the model and reduce the dimensionality, using Lasso and p-value.
Sentiment analysis of comments.
Performance was analyzed using MAE, MSE and R² metrics.
Weaknesses:
Adequate data preparation and feature selection must be performed on a sound basis.

⮚ How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?
(If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided
publish the article).
The paper provides knowledge on Airbnb price prediction by integrating sentiment analysis and machine learning
 techniques, such as Ridge regression and SVR. Feature selection, reducing the complexity of the dataset,
  improves the efficiency and accuracy of the models. 
  Empirical comparison of models reveals that SVR excels in accuracy, and the best data handling capability is observed.

⮚ What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?
Based on paper, first, studying other feature selection schemes such as Random Forest feature importance and second, further experimentation with neural net architectures.
