## Report 2: Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis (Pouya Rezazadeh, Liubov Nikolenko & Hoormazd Rezaei, 2019)

### 1) What is the research question of the article?
The research aims to accurately determine prices on Airbnb given the available information, proposing the development of a predictive pricing model that incorporates machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques. The authors seek to address how to reliably predict the rental price of properties on Airbnb using property characteristics, owner characteristics, and sentiment analysis of customer reviews as explanatory variables, through feature selection and comparison of various models in terms of their performance. This approach aims to assist both owners and customers in evaluating prices, considering the available information about the property.

### 2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

A key strength of the article lies in its detailed and thorough approach to feature selection and comparison of various machine learning models for predicting Airbnb prices. By implementing advanced techniques such as support vector regression, neural networks, and sentiment analysis in customer reviews, the study identifies and evaluates the effectiveness of each method, providing valuable insights to enhance the accuracy of rental price predictions.

One weakness of the article is the limited number of training examples available, which may have constrained the complexity of certain models and potentially impacted their performance. Additionally, the study acknowledges the need for more diverse training examples from various hospitality services to further enhance the predictive model's accuracy and generalizability.

### 3) How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

The main contribution of the article lies in the introduction of sentiment analysis through customer reviews as a relevant feature in the predictive model for Airbnb prices. By incorporating this subjective information into the analysis, the study offers a more comprehensive perspective on the factors influencing pricing on the platform. This innovation allows for a deeper understanding of how customer opinions and experiences affect the perception of a property's value.

### 4) What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

The first step would be to expand the dataset to include more training examples. This would allow for better generalization of the models and help address potential overfitting issues by having a more representative sample of the population. Additionally, by including data from other cities, the robustness and applicability of the model in different geographical contexts could be evaluated. 
Furthermore, it would be interesting to continue the analysis for high-demand seasons and explore how this influences prices.
