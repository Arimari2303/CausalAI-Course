##•	What is the research question of the article?

How to develop a reliable price prediction model for Airbnb listings using machine learning, deep learning,
 and natural language processing techniques to assist property owners and customers in evaluating prices with minimal available 
information about the property.

##•	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to answering that question?

The document provides a comprehensive analysis due to the employment of machine learning techniques 
as linear regression, tree-based models, and neural networks. It also uses the sentiment analysis on customer reviews, 
enhancing the understanding of the factors influencing pricing. The principal weakness is the limited range of feature selection 
schemes and training examples.

##•	How does this paper advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution?

This paper advances knowledge by offering a exhaustive approach to predicting Airbnb prices, integrating machine learning 
techniques with sentiment analysis of customer reviews. It provides insights into the effectiveness of various models and 
feature selection methods, contributing to the understanding of factors influencing rental pricing on platforms like Airbnb. 
The authors manage to obtain relatively high values of R squared, which demonstrates the accuracy of the best performing model 
(Support Vector Regression)

##•	What would be one or two valuable and specific next steps to advance this question?

As listed on the conclusion, further exploration of feature selection schemes beyond Lasso-based analysis, such as Random Forest
 feature importance, could enhance model performance and robustness. 	In the second place, experimentation with different neural 
net architectures could provide insights into improving predictive accuracy and understanding complex interactions within the dataset.
