The paper written by Susan Athey and Guido W.Imbens sets an opening question: “Why has the acceptance of ML methods been so much slower in econometrics compared to the broader statistics community”. This new culture of algorithmic modeling has advanced rapidly in fields outside statistics and offers promising advantages to reach conclusions from both large and small datasets. It is because of these potential benefits that the authors pose the thesis that economists and econometricians need to stop heavily depending on traditional data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools. This “persuasive” thesis seeks to call for innovation in econometrics and to convince the experts of the area of embracing new methodology. This thesis sets a second, but not less important question: “How can we adapt ML methods to econometrics?”.

The major strength of the article is the open discussion of the goals that econometrics and ML have, and in which approaches they converge and in which they differ. Chapter 2 does a wonderful job stating that the main objective of econometrics is to find causal relationships and statistically proper estimands, whereas ML looks to make predictions using a training sample. However, in section 2.8 they question whether inference and the construction of confidence intervals is more important than predictive power, which may not be the case for many decision problems. A second strength to highlight is the link made between ML methods presented in chapters 3, 4 and 5 and their potential use in econometrics. After explaining the functionality behind random forests for example, the authors connect it to traditional econometrics methods where the interest relies on finding causal effects or finding parameters. Finally, a third strength from the paper is the revision of econometric methods, like ATE and CATE and what ML has to offer them. Chapter 6 indicates ways to apply ML methods, the most important issues in trying to adapt them and proposed solutions in previous works. As a whole, these strengths provide an exhaustive content of the most important advancements in econometrics and ML and the latest efforts and developments to combine the two. 

The prominent weakness of the article is the lack of a structured section of applications of these algorithmic methods in current economic research. Along the document, the authors present a variety of supervised and unsupervised methods and explain the theory behind them. In that same line, they mention authors and literature related to the respective method and the effort to theoretically apply it to economics. Nonetheless, there is little to no mention of published economic investigations using these ML methods or at least in the process of being published.

The document’s contribution isn’t to add new information or methodologies, but to persuade and gather information precisely. Persuasive in the sense that it tries to convince the econometric community of the benefits of algorithmic models. In doing so, the authors gather the latest developments from ML and their increasingly noticeable contributions for economics. The article poses an alarming thesis and calls for quick action and innovation, while explaining the disruptiveness behind these models. Thus, it is an important publication and adds great value to the scientific and research community.

For instance, a valuable step is to continue questioning if inference and confidence intervals are more important than predictive power. In economics, topics related to risk assessment, economic cycles and even policy evaluation may benefit from the approach over prediction power. In policy evaluation for example, while estimating causal effects is important for evaluating the impact of economic policies, predictive modeling can also play a role in assessing the likely outcomes of different policy interventions. On the other hand, if we can further elaborate over the existing ML methods and tune them to find causal relationships, its acceptance will be inevitable and just a matter of time in econometrics.
