# This is the report 1 for paper "Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know About" of Susan Athey and Guido W. Imbens

The article give to all the economists and statiscians a lesson about how we can complement our knowledge with the tools that Machine Learning provides. The question this text pretend to answer is what are the most relevant machine learning methods for economists, and how can they be applied in economic research and data analysis to enhance understanding and prediction of economic phenomena. So, in this report, we are going to explore the key points discussed in the article of Athey and Imbens and the importance for the economy world.

At first, the article show the relevance of Machine Learning on this days in many sciences and whereas the world implement easily the ML methods, economy do it in small steps. Then, the authors, as the main topic, discuss about a variety of machine learning methods, economy procedures and how this two areas converge or they are on process. It is import to emphasize that no matters the differences or troubles, the authors show the importance of these methods for economists as a powerfull predictive tool.

In the article, as it was said, econometric and ML literature have their own differences like terminology, if you focus on efficiency or making predictions and so on. However, there are ML methods that are usefull when you want to estimate. The text present four methods: Regularized Linear Regression: LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Nets, Regression Trees and Forests, Deep Learning and Neural Nets, and Boosting.

In terms of estimation, these machine learning methods have diverse applications in economics, such as predicting GDP growth, analyzing financial markets, evaluating economic policies, and detecting patterns in large economic datasets.
In my point of view, I disagree with the statement that one limitation is how big is the sample in ML. In essence, the problem of the sample is solved in real economy with assumptions or you can talk in theory but not in practice. So, at the end, you con code your model with the assumptions to make ML methods more usefull. 

To sum up, all these new advantages and codes, must be shared and classified by topic, method, model, goal or other filters. In this way, the Economy probably can approach a little bit more to real life using ML.
